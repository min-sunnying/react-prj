The blossoms also hold special significance in Japanese culture, symbolizing both the transience of life and the concept of mono no aware, a bittersweet awareness of the impermanence of all things. In the United States, the National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington D.C. commemorates the gift of 3,000 cherry trees from Japan in 1912.

        "response": "Okay, here is a longer essay on the topic of paying college athletes:\n\nThe question of whether college athletes should be paid is one that has been debated for decades. While some argue that they should be compensated for the time and effort that they put into their sports, others maintain that receiving a scholarship to attend college is compensation enough. In this essay, we will explore the arguments for and against paying college athletes in more detail.\n\nOne of the primary arguments against paying college athletes is that they already receive a scholarship to attend college. Many people argue that this scholarship is compensation enough for the time and effort that they put into their sport. After all, a free education is a valuable commodity, and many people argue that it is worth much more than any monetary compensation that they might receive.\n\nFurthermore, some people argue that paying college athletes would undermine the amateur nature of college sports. College sports are supposed to be about promoting school spirit and fostering a sense of community on campus. When athletes are paid, it is no longer about school spirit, but rather about money. This could lead to a decline in attendance at games and a reduction in the overall spirit of college sports.\n\nAnother argument against paying college athletes is that it would be difficult to determine how much each athlete should be paid. Some sports are more popular than others, and some athletes are more valuable to their team than others. For example, the quarterback of a football team is likely to be more valuable than a backup player on the fencing team. It would be difficult to determine an equitable system for paying athletes that takes these factors into account.\n\nDespite these arguments, many people believe that college athletes should be paid. One of the primary arguments in favor of paying athletes is that they generate significant revenue for their schools. The NCAA generates billions of dollars each year from college sports, and yet the athletes who play a crucial role in generating this revenue do not receive any kind of financial compensation. This seems unfair to many people.\n\nFurthermore, some people argue that it is unfair to use the image and likeness of college athletes to promote their programs and generate revenue without providing fair compensation. Colleges and universities use images of their athletes in advertisements and on merchandise to generate revenue, and yet the athletes themselves do not receive any compensation for this use of their image.\n\nAnother argument in favor of paying college athletes is that it would help to reduce scandals involving improper benefits. If athletes were allowed to receive fair compensation for their time and effort, there would be less temptation to accept improper benefits from outside sources. This would help to preserve the integrity of college sports programs and promote a level playing field for all athletes.\n\nSo, what would paying college athletes look like in practice? One proposed solution is a revenue-sharing model that would distribute funds equally among athletes in all sports, regardless of the level of revenue generated by their program. This would help to address concerns about equitable pay and the amateur nature of college sports. Another suggestion is to allow athletes to receive compensation for the use of their image and likeness, such as through endorsements or sponsorships.\n\nThe topic of paying college athletes is a complex one with valid arguments on both sides. Ultimately, the decision about whether to pay college athletes or not will come down to a question of values. On the one hand, proponents of paying college athletes argue that it is only fair to compensate them for the time and effort that they put into their sport. On the other hand, opponents maintain that the scholarship that athletes receive to attend college is compensation enough. It is up to us as a society to decide which values we want to prioritize when it comes to college sports.",

        "response": "Of course! Here is a longer essay on the topic of paying college athletes:\n\nFor many years, college athletes have been generating billions of dollars in revenue for their respective institutions. This has led to an ongoing debate on whether these athletes should be compensated beyond the scholarships that they receive for their time and effort on the field. While some believe that these scholarships are fair compensation, others suggest that student-athletes deserve equitable compensation for their role in generating revenue. In this essay, we will delve deeper into this topic, exploring the arguments for and against paying college athletes, and proposing a possible solution.\n\nFor many student-athletes, playing a sport at the college level is akin to a full-time job. The NCAA imposes strict limits on the time that student-athletes can spend on their sports outside of the official season. However, the fact remains that many athletes still dedicate an enormous amount of their time and energy to their sport. They are required to attend practices, games, and training sessions; and must also devote time to maintaining their grades. Student-athletes are expected to act as full-time athletes while also fulfilling their academic obligations. Given the time and effort that is required of them, many believe that it is only fair to provide these athletes with additional compensation.\n\nIn contrast, opponents of paying college athletes suggest that the scholarships that are provided to student-athletes are sufficient compensation for their efforts. These scholarships cover tuition, room, board, and textbooks, which can amount to tens of thousands of dollars in value each year. For many student-athletes, this is a significant benefit and a financial burden that would make college attendance impossible without the scholarship. The opposition may argue that these scholarships are given to students due to their athletic ability, not for playing sports to be a job, and so therefore should not be paid salaries for playing sports.\n\nWhile scholarships can certainly provide financial assistance for student-athletes, it does not necessarily provide a way for them to earn an equitable wage. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) restricts student-athletes from earning money off their name, image, or likeness. While the NCAA can use an athlete's name, image or likeness to profit from merchandise sales or promotions, the athlete cannot do the same. In this way, the NCAA is making money off an athlete's performance without providing them with the same opportunity, which some people see as unjust.\n\nAdditionally, some critics argue that athletes who play \"revenue sports,\" such as football and basketball, are generating far more revenue for their universities than the scholarship that they receive. For example, football programs alone generate billions in revenue each year, which can be distributed to coaches, administrators, and other stakeholders of the sport. In contrast, student-athletes receive no compensation beyond their scholarship. This lack of compensation is one of the main reasons why many believe that athletes should be paid.\n\nOpponents of paying college athletes counter these arguments by suggesting that paying college athletes would result in a loss of amateurism. Since college athletics is not a profession, student-athletes are not considered employees or professionals. The idea is to preserve college sports as a competition among amateurs, as opposed to a professional sport where players are paid. Additionally, they add that if college athletes were to receive compensation, it might become less about athletics and more about making money.\n\nOne solution to the problem of compensating athletes equitably is to implement a revenue-sharing model. This revenue-sharing model would allow colleges and universities to compensate student-athletes based on the revenue earned for the institution. This would be a way to ensure that the athletes who played a significant role in generating revenue for their school receive an equitable share. Additionally, this method differs from a salary or wage system, which focuses on paying college athletes directly for playing their respective sports. In this way, it is different from professional sports, which compensate athletes as a matter of course.\n\nAnother possible solution would be to allow student-athletes to receive compensation for the use of their name, image, and likeness. This would give the athlete a chance to earn money off their performance and popularity. The common argument against this solution is that it might lead to some colleges and universities to buy the best prospects to bolster their athletic programs. However, the decision to sign a specific player would be completely up to the athlete, and not the school.\n\nIn conclusion, the question of whether college athletes should be paid is a complex one, with valid points on both sides. Some argue that scholarships for athletes are ample compensation, but others believe that that reasonable compensation is necessary given the billions of dollars generated by college sports each year. The implementation of a revenue-sharing model, offering the opportunity for student-athletes to earn money off their performance, could provide a solution for this dilemma. Ultimately, irrespective of the chose course of action, substantial change is essential to fix the inequities in college athletic programs.",

It refers to long-term changes in temperature, rainfall, wind, and other environmental factors which have serious impacts on the earth's natural processes. The consequences of climate change are felt all around the globe and have been linked to severe weather events such as floods, droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes. In this essay, we will explore the causes and impacts of climate change, as well as what can be done to mitigate its effects.\n\nOne of the primary causes of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide trap heat in the earth’s atmosphere and cause a warming effect on the planet. Human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation are the primary sources of these gases. In addition to this, the agricultural industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gases, particularly due to livestock production.\n\nThe effects of climate change are already being seen around the world. Melting glaciers and rising sea levels led to flooding and the loss of land in many coastal areas. Warmer temperatures and changing rainfall patterns have impacted agriculture and food production. The ocean's temperature also increases, which leads to coral bleaching and the extinction of marine species.\n\nVarious solutions have been proposed to mitigate the impact of climate change. One of these is increasing the use of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower instead of relying on fossil fuels. The expansion of electric vehicles and the availability of public transportation could also help reduce the use of fossil fuels in the transportation industry. Additionally, the promotion of energy-efficient buildings and homes, and the introduction of plane trees in urban areas to reduce the urban heat island effect, which is caused due to heat absorption by the urban infrastructure itself – all of these can make a significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAnother key solution is to reduce meat consumption and increase plant-based diets for a more sustainable future. Animal agriculture is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. Reducing meat consumption, particularly beef, can help reduce carbon emissions immensely. Eating more plant-based and organically grown food helps reduce greenhouse gases while also being better for your health in general.\n\nAnother approach is the conservation of forests, particularly tropical rainforests, which are among the most biodiverse areas on the planet. Deforestation is one of the leading factors in climate change, contributing to 15% of global carbon emissions. Preventing deforestation and re-forestation of necessary areas can absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of climate change is one that has to be addressed urgently. The causes and impacts of climate change are global and have severe consequences. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting the use of renewables, reducing meat consumption, promoting afforestation, and reforestation are vital for creating a sustainable future. It is left on us to make a change, and change begins with our attitudes and actions on a day-to-day basis.",

It is a genetic system used to identify and study protein-protein interactions, which helps to elucidate the function of proteins and their role in cellular pathways. The basic principle of the system is the ability of transcriptional activation domains (AD) and DNA-binding domains (BD) to interact when brought together, allowing for the activation of a reporter gene.\n\nEssentially, the yeast-2-hybrid system relies on the activation of a reporter gene based on protein-protein interactions. The interaction between a bait protein and a prey protein brings the AD and BD domains together, resulting in the transcriptional activation of a reporter gene. This can be used to identify potential protein-protein interactions, map protein interaction networks and study protein function.\n\nThe yeast-2-hybrid system has been extensively used to study interactions between individual proteins as well as large-scale protein interaction networks. This approach has been used in model organisms such as yeast, Drosophila and humans to identify novel interactions and elucidate protein function. The technique has been used to identify interactions between transcription factors, kinases, and other regulatory proteins.\n\nIn conclusion, the yeast-2-hybrid system is a powerful tool for studying protein-protein interactions, elucidating protein function and mapping protein interaction networks. It has proven to be a useful approach for identifying novel protein interactions and mapping functional pathways, and it will likely continue to be an essential tool for studying protein interactions in the future.",

        "response": "As I scroll through my Instagram feed, I stumble across a solemn post from a fellow graduate student. It's a familiar feeling, the sense of anxiety and self-doubt that creeps in during times of academic stress. It's something I've experienced firsthand.\n\nThe post reads, \"What have I been thinking about lately?\" It's a simple question, but it speaks volumes. The author goes on to describe the feelings of inadequacy that have been building within them. They speak of a sense that time is slipping away, that the moments they have to reach their potential are few and far between. It's a feeling that many of us can relate to, especially in times of academic pressure.\n\nThe author goes on to describe the solace they found in writing a paper - a chance to hold onto something concrete in the midst of what feels like an increasingly ephemeral existence. It's a small gesture, but a powerful one - a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, we can still do something meaningful.\n\nAs I read on, I'm struck by the author's honesty. They recount the doubts that plagued them as they wrote, the nagging sense that they might not be on the right path. It's a feeling that can be all-consuming for graduate students, and it's something I've struggled with myself. But the author doesn't linger on this feeling of doubt for long. Instead, they find peace in the simple pleasures of life - the small moments of beauty and connection that remind us why we're here in the first place.\n\nIt's a reminder that we don't always have to be striving for something more, that sometimes the most meaningful moments are the ones that happen in between. As the author puts it, \"Life is good when it's tranquil.\" It's a sentiment that's easy to forget in the hustle and bustle of academic life, but one that's worth holding onto.\n\nAnd even though the author's paper didn't turn out as they had hoped, they're quick to remind themselves and their readers that there's always another opportunity to try again. \"If this paper didn't work out, there's always the next one,\" they write. It's a message of hope and resilience that's well worth taking to heart.\n\nAs I finish reading the post, I'm struck by how much it resonates with me. We all have moments of doubt and uncertainty, but it's the small gestures of hope and resiliency that can make all the difference. So hang onto those moments of beauty and connection, even in the midst of chaos. And remember, there's always another chance to try again.",

        "response": "Great, let's begin. Here's an example of how to apply the comma rule to your essay: \n\n\"The debate on whether college athletes should be paid for their participation in sports has been ongoing. While scholarships cover some expenses, they do not always suffice.\"\n\nIn this sentence, you don't need a comma because there are only two elements in the sentence - \"scholarships\" and \"expenses\" - and they are not separated by a conjunction. However, if you wanted to, you could add a comma after \"expenses\" to make the sentence read more smoothly: \"While scholarships cover some expenses, they do not always suffice.\" \n\nNext, let's look at the next paragraph: \n\n\"College sports generate significant revenue, and athletes who play a crucial role in generating this revenue do not receive any share. Some argue that it is unfair to use the image and likeness of college athletes to promote their programs and generate revenue without providing fair compensation.\"\n\nHere, you correctly separated the two parts of the list with a comma. Well done! \n\nIn the next paragraph: \n\n\"Despite the arguments against paying college athletes, many believe that they should be compensated for their time and effort. A revenue-sharing model could provide fair compensation to athletes while preserving the integrity of college sports programs. Such a model would distribute funds equally among athletes in all sports, regardless of the level of revenue generated by their program. Overall, the topic of paying college athletes is a complex issue, and both sides have valid arguments that should be carefully considered.\"\n\nThere are no lists in this paragraph, so we don't need to use commas in this case. \n\nFinally, it's important to remember that there are other comma rules that we didn't go over in class today, such as using commas after introductory phrases or clauses, among other things. As you revise your essay, be sure to review all of the comma rules and use them appropriately.",

It is caused by a variety of factors, including human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. The effects of climate change are far-reaching and include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, and the loss of biodiversity. However, there are solutions that can help mitigate the effects of climate change and prevent further damage to our planet.\n\nOne of the primary causes of climate change is the burning of fossil fuels. This releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and cause the planet to warm. Deforestation is another major contributor to climate change, as trees absorb carbon dioxide and help regulate the Earth's temperature. When forests are destroyed, this natural process is disrupted, leading to increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\nThe effects of climate change are already being felt around the world. Rising sea levels are causing coastal flooding and erosion, while more frequent and severe weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires are becoming increasingly common. These events can have devastating consequences for communities and ecosystems, leading to loss of life, property damage, and the displacement of people and wildlife.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by climate change, there are solutions that can help mitigate its effects. One of the most important is to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. This will not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also create new jobs and stimulate economic growth. Another solution is to protect and restore forests, which can help absorb carbon dioxide and provide habitat for wildlife.\n\nIn addition to these solutions, individuals can also take action to reduce their carbon footprint and help combat climate change. This can include simple actions such as using energy-efficient light bulbs, reducing water usage, and recycling. By making small changes in our daily lives, we can all contribute to a more sustainable future.\n\nIn conclusion, climate change is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to address. By reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, protecting and restoring forests, and taking individual action, we can help mitigate the effects of climate change and create a more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.",

        "response": "Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today. It is a phenomenon that has been caused by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrialization. The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world, with rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, and the loss of biodiversity. It is imperative that we take action to address this issue before it is too late.\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of climate change is the rise in global temperatures. This has led to melting ice caps and glaciers, which in turn has caused sea levels to rise. This rise in sea levels is already having a devastating impact on coastal communities, with flooding becoming more frequent and severe. In addition, the warming of the oceans is causing coral reefs to die off, which is having a significant impact on marine ecosystems.\n\nAnother impact of climate change is the increase in extreme weather events. This includes more frequent and severe hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves. These events are having a significant impact on agriculture, with crops being destroyed and food prices rising. In addition, extreme weather events are causing significant damage to infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and buildings.\n\nThe loss of biodiversity is another significant impact of climate change. As temperatures rise, many species are struggling to adapt to the changing conditions. This is leading to a decline in the number of species, which is having a significant impact on ecosystems around the world. In addition, the loss of biodiversity is having a significant impact on human health, with the loss of natural habitats leading to the spread of diseases.\n\nTo address climate change, we need to take action on multiple fronts. This includes reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, promoting renewable energy sources, and investing in energy-efficient technologies. We also need to take steps to protect our forests and other natural habitats, which are critical for absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Finally, we need to work together as a global community to address this issue, with countries around the world working together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.\n\nIn conclusion, climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today. It is having a significant impact on our environment, our economy, and our health. We need to take action now to address this issue before it is too late. By working together, we can create a more sustainable future for ourselves and for future generations.",

By enforcing a strict dress code, schools suppress students' ability to express themselves through clothing choices. Adolescence is a critical period for self-discovery and identity formation, and school uniforms hinder this process by creating a homogenous environment that discourages uniqueness.",

While you mention that school uniforms suppress individuality, it would be helpful to provide specific examples or studies that demonstrate this effect. This will make your argument more convincing and credible.\n\n2. Consider addressing counterarguments. While you make a strong case for why school uniforms should be abolished, it's important to acknowledge and address potential counterarguments. For example, some may argue that school uniforms promote equality and reduce bullying based on clothing choices. By addressing these counterarguments, you can strengthen your argument and show that you have considered multiple perspectives.\n\n3. Use transitions to connect your ideas. While your essay has a clear structure, it would be helpful to use transitions to connect your ideas and make your writing flow more smoothly. For example, you could use phrases like \"in addition,\" \"however,\" or \"on the other hand\" to signal shifts in your argument.\n\nOverall, your essay has a strong thesis and clear structure. By providing more evidence, addressing counterarguments, and using transitions, you can make your argument even more persuasive. Good luck!",

Government is here for everyone. It is true that when the government help people in need, it will be able to help people as much as possible, which will be very helpful for them. However, the fact that helping people in need has many positive aspects does not meas that it is okay to ‘not help others’. Government only working for a small part of people and ignoring the rest should not happen. Also, I think it is unfair either. I agree to helping a bit more to the people in need. There are people who can’t live without some help of the government. There are problems that government should deal with in order to help people. However, only helping those who need help could be viewed as discriminating others. As I already wrote, government is an organization for all. Making nobody feel discriminated by the government is the way I think government should go. \nSecondly, in a realistic point of view, government could not exist only with those who are in need, so that they should take care of others. For example, government is managed by money that people pay as tax. To get much tax, they should have many people who are rich in the country. In order to keep them in the country, the country should do something for them. If the government only help those in need and ignore others, the government could not exist. Therefore, the best way to help those in need is not just helping them fully but helping them steady. \nThese are the reasons why I think government should help all of its citizens regardless of their socioeconomic background.",

Use effective coherence devices to connect your ideas and make your essay flow smoothly. \n\nHere are some suggestions for improving the coherence of your essay: \n\n- Use transition words and phrases to connect your ideas. For example, you could use \"firstly,\" \"secondly,\" \"in addition,\" \"however,\" \"therefore,\" etc. \n\n- Use pronouns to refer back to previously mentioned ideas. For example, instead of repeating \"government\" multiple times, you could use \"it\" or \"they\" to refer back to the government. \n\n- Use parallel structure to make your ideas more clear and organized. For example, you could start each paragraph with a similar sentence structure, such as \"Firstly,...\" and \"Secondly,...\" \n\n3. Make sure your ideas are organized logically. \n\nHere are some suggestions for organizing your essay: \n\n- Start with a clear thesis statement that summarizes your argument. \n\n- In your first paragraph, introduce your argument and provide some background information. \n\n- In your second paragraph, explain why it is important for the government to help all of its citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic background. Use specific examples to support your argument. \n\n- In your third paragraph, address potential counterarguments and explain why your argument is still valid. \n\n- Conclude your essay by summarizing your argument and restating your thesis statement. \n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful!

This is crucial because low-income households are disadvantaged when it comes to accessing quality healthcare and require special attention.\n\nFinally, governments should focus on providing educational opportunities to marginalized communities.

In my opinion, the government should focus on helping those in need, as it can make a more significant impact on their lives and improve the overall wellbeing of society.\n\nFirstly, providing assistance to all citizens can be inefficient and ineffective. The government has limited resources, and distributing them equally to all citizens would not address the individual needs and circumstances of each person. For example, if a wealthy businessman receives the same healthcare benefits as a low-income family, it would be unfair and less effective in addressing the health issues of the latter. Thus, prioritizing those in need would allow the government to allocate its resources more efficiently and help those who require the most assistance.\n\nFurthermore, providing aid to those in need can help reduce inequality and improve social mobility. When individuals or families face significant financial hardships, they often lack the resources to access education, healthcare, or other opportunities that can improve their future prospects. By providing assistance, the government can help reduce the economic and social barriers that hold back individuals and groups and allow them to reach their full potential. This can lead to more opportunities and a better quality of life for everyone in society.\n\nFinally, focusing on those in need can help the government build trust and promote social cohesion. When people feel that their government cares about their well-being and takes action to help those who are struggling, it can foster a sense of community and solidarity. Conversely, if the government provides aid indiscriminately, it can create resentment and division among citizens. By targeting assistance to those who need it most, the government can promote a more inclusive and supportive society.\n\nIn conclusion, the government should focus on helping those in need, as it can ensure the efficient and effective distribution of resources, reduce inequality, and promote social cohesion. While some may argue that providing assistance to all citizens is fairer, it would not address the specific needs and circumstances of those who are struggling the most. By prioritizing those in need, the government can make a more significant impact and create a more just and equitable society. \n\nWhat do you think of this draft?

In my opinion, the government should focus on helping those in need, as it can make a more significant impact on their lives and improve the overall wellbeing of society.\n\nFirstly, providing assistance to all citizens can be inefficient and ineffective.

Universal assistance programs can benefit those who do not actually require financial assistance.\n3.

Here's an example of how the government can reduce inequality and improve social mobility:\n\nOne way the government can reduce inequality and improve social mobility is by investing in education. Providing access to quality education for all citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic status, can help level the playing field and provide opportunities for upward mobility. This can be achieved through policies such as increasing funding for public schools, expanding access to early childhood education, and providing financial aid for higher education.\n\nAnother example is through progressive taxation. By implementing a tax system that taxes the wealthy at a higher rate, the government can redistribute wealth and reduce income inequality. This can be achieved through policies such as increasing the top marginal tax rate, implementing a wealth tax, or closing tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy.\n\nFinally, the government can also improve social mobility by providing access to affordable housing and healthcare. These basic needs are essential for individuals to be able to pursue education and career opportunities. Policies such as expanding access to affordable housing and implementing a universal healthcare system can help reduce the financial burden on low-income families and provide a foundation for upward mobility.\n\nNow, let's take a look at your essay and see how we can improve it.

So, they get little chance for learning something and improving abilities. For instance, many universities and companies prefer a person who can perform well but the people who are in need can't satisfy others need due to their insufficient learning and chances. As a result, to get a much better status and chances the poors need government's help.\nSecond, people might think it is unfair to help elders,but all human beings will get old and need helps to live. The government should care about their citizens' future and continue to help elders. Therefore. the taxes and little unfairness you have to experience will return to you in the future.\nLastly, if the government doesn't focus on helping people in need, the differnce between people's socioeconomic status will be get worse. As a result, the society might become more unstable. For example, historically, there are more conflict between the poor and the rich. It can be expected that there will be more comlaint, if the unbalanced chances and money are getting more bigger.\nGovernment's purpose is to maintain society's peace and balanced state. So, they should help people in need more carefully to ensure their chance to learn and become sucessful. Also, for the citizen's future, government should help elders.

However, there are some areas where we can improve the essay using the concepts of organizational and syntactic parallelism. \n\nFirst, let's focus on organizational parallelism. It's important to transition smoothly between paragraphs and present your ideas in a logical and chronological manner. Here's an example of a revised introduction that uses organizational parallelism:\n\n\"In modern society, it is crucial to ensure fair opportunities and well-being for all citizens. To achieve this, governments should concentrate on supporting those in need, such as individuals from low-income households and the elderly. By providing education, resources, and aid, governments can contribute to a more equitable society that values the potential of all its members.\"\n\nIn this revised introduction, we've used parallel structure to emphasize the importance of supporting those in need and to highlight the actions that the government can take to make a positive impact.\n\nNext, let's look at syntactic parallelism. You've explained the concept well in your summary, and I think your essay could benefit from using this technique more consistently. Here's an example of how you can revise a sentence to use parallel structure:\n\nOriginal: \"For instance, many universities and companies prefer a person who can perform well but the people who are in need can't satisfy others need due to their insufficient learning and chances.\"\n\nRevised: \"For instance, many universities and companies prefer individuals who can perform well, but those in need often lack the opportunities and resources to develop their skills.\"\n\nBy using parallel structure in this sentence, we've simplified the language and made the sentence more concise and easy to follow.\n\nFinally, let's focus on the conclusion. It's important to summarize the main points of the essay and restate the thesis in a memorable way. Here's an example of a revised conclusion that uses parallelism:\n\n\"In conclusion, governments play a crucial role in ensuring a fair and equitable society by supporting those in need. By providing education, aid, and resources to individuals from low-income households and the elderly, governments can help pave the way for a more equitable future. By investing in the potential of all members of society, we can create a world where opportunity is accessible to all.\" \n\nBy using repetition and parallel structure in the final sentence, we've provided a clear and memorable statement that emphasizes the importance of government aid for all citizens.\n\nI hope these revisions help you improve your essay and apply the concepts of organizational and syntactic parallelism!",

So, they get little chance for learning something and improving abilities. For instance, many universities and companies prefer a person who can perform well but the people who are in need can't satisfy others need due to their insufficient learning and chances. As a result, to get a much better status and chances the poors need government's help.\nSecond, people might think it is unfair to help elders,but all human beings will get old and need helps to live. The government should care about their citizens' future and continue to help elders. Therefore. the taxes and little unfairness you have to experience will return to you in the future.\nLastly, if the government doesn't focus on helping people in need, the differnce between people's socioeconomic status will be get worse. As a result, the society might become more unstable. For example, historically, there are more conflict between the poor and the rich. It can be expected that there will be more comlaint, if the unbalanced chances and money are getting more bigger.\nGovernment's purpose is to maintain society's peace and balanced state. So, they should help people in need more carefully to ensure their chance to learn and become sucessful. Also, for the citizen's future, government should help elders.

In the first sentence, you can add a comma after \"citizens\" to make it clear that you are listing two separate things that the government tries to provide: equal chances and resources. \n\n2. You should use quotation marks when you are directly quoting someone or something. In your essay, you did not include any direct quotes, so we do not need to use any quotation marks.\n\n3. When describing actions in your essay, you should use verb form rather than noun form. For example, instead of saying \"due to their reduced abilities,\" you can say \"because they have reduced abilities.\"\n\n4. You can revise the sentence \"Childern who are born into poor families will face difficulties.\" to \"Children born into poor families will face difficulties.\" \n\n5. To make your essay more effective, you can avoid using generalizations and instead provide specific examples to illustrate your points. For example, to support your argument that the poor do not have equal access to high-quality education, you can provide an example of a specific school or district that lacks resources or a specific program for low-income students. \n\n6. In the sentence \"More specifically, as people get old, their abilities to work reduce, so they have to retire and they are not financially independent anymore,\" you can revise it to \"As people age, their ability to work decreases, and they become financially dependent on others.\"\n\n7. Finally, you can revise the last sentence to \"In conclusion, to maintain societal peace and balance, governments should focus on supporting and empowering historically dismissed and overlooked minorities.\" \n\nI hope these suggestions help you to revise your essay. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the points.",

        "response": "Government is different from past monarchy, because it tries to provide equal chances and resources to citzens. However, even in modern society, there are differences of economic and social status between people. Childern who are born into poor families will face difficulties. Also, elders need more help than others due to their reduced abilities. Therefore, to make a nation a better place,  government should concentrate on supporting people in need. By providing education, resources, and aid to them, governments can contribute to a more equitable society.\nThe most serious problem that government should consider is differences of background of a person's childhood. The poors are not likely to get high quality education or supports than others. As a result, they are not likely to improve abilities to have a better status in society. For instance, university is important for a person's various experience for success. However, many universities prefer a person who can perform well. Moreover, some elite universities require quite huge amount of money to register. But what people in need can't satisfy are these external academic supports, because of their environment. Government should make a policy that tries to enhance public education to reduce the other external acardemic supports' influence. In addition, to reduce the economic burden for poors, proper aid of money should be contained in the policy.\nAnother point to consider is  people who are getting old. Some might think it is unfair to help elders, but all human beings become old. The government should care about their citizens' future and continue to help elders. More specifically, as people get old, their abilities to work reduce, so they have to retire and are not financially independent anymore. Also, they are vulnerable to diseases and medical conditions that require constant attention and medical intervention. Government should not left them in these poor conditions, because they have been contribute to society and still have a wealth of knowledge, skills, and experience that can be helpful for society. Therefore, government should provide seniors with medical and economical supports that contribute to the well-being of both society and individuals who are aging.\nLast thing government should care about is stabilty of the society. If the government doesn't focus on helping people in need, the differnce between people's socioeconomic status will worsen. Consequently, the society might become more unstable. Historically, it is clear that there are more conflicts between people when the inequality of chances and unbalanced wealth are evident. For example,  society may experience high rates of crime and violence, as individuals compete for resources and power. Also, societies may suffer from a breakdown in social connections and trust, leading to societal disintegration and a loss of collective values. Hence, government have to care more about people in need for social benefits and stabilty.\n Nowadays, most governments around the world seems to function well, but there are major problems related to the inequality of social status and wealth. These are problems what democracy systems have to solve. One way to adress these problems is strengthening policies that support the social underprivileged. The government should help people in need more carefully to ensure their chance to learn and become sucessful. Moreover, for the citizen's future, government should aid seniors with economical and medical supports that acknowledge the valuable contributions they have made to society. In conclusion, to achieve the critical role of government maintaining society's peace and balanced state, they should concentrate on supporting minorities who have been historically dismissed and overlooked.

Here is how we can start revising your essay based on what you learned today.\n\nFirst, I recommend reading through your essay and identifying any lists with two or more elements.\nOnce you have identified these lists, make sure to add a comma after each element, separating them clearly.\n\nFor example:\n\nBefore revision: My favorite fruits are apples bananas and oranges.\n\nAfter revision: My favorite fruits are apples, bananas, and oranges.\n\nNext, it is important to double-check that you are using commas correctly in any complex sentences. Here are some common comma rules we discussed in class to help guide you:\n\n1. Use a comma to separate independent clauses when they are joined by a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet) - for example: I like to read books, but I prefer to watch movies.\n\n2. Use a comma after introductory words or phrases - for example: Before we begin our lesson, let's review last week's material.\n\n3. Use commas to set off non-essential clauses or phrases - for example: My friend Emily, who is traveling to Europe next week, loves to try new foods.\n\nRemember, good writing takes practice, so don't be afraid to revise your essay multiple times until it is clear, concise, and error-free.",

        "response": "Great question! Syntactic parallelism is a writing technique that involves using grammatically parallel structures in a sentence or paragraph. Essentially, it means using the same grammatical structure to connect related ideas or items. This helps to make the writing clearer, more organized, and more memorable to the reader.\n\nHere's an example of syntactic parallelism:\n\nNon-parallel: The child was laughing, jumping up and was singing his favorite song.\n\nParallel: The child was laughing, jumping up, and singing his favorite song.\n\nIn the non-parallel sentence, the verb forms used for laughing, jumping, and singing are different, creating an uneven structure. In the parallel sentence, each verb is expressed in the same gerund form, creating a more balanced and pleasing structure.\n\nTo use syntactic parallelism in your writing, you can start by identifying related ideas or items that you want to connect in a sentence or paragraph. Then, try to use the same grammatical structure for each item. This might include using the same verb tense, the same prepositional phrase, or the same noun.\n\nRemember, using syntactic parallelism can help to improve the clarity and effectiveness of your writing, but it should be used sparingly and appropriately. Overuse of parallel structures can make your writing sound repetitive or boring.",

This can create a stilted, monotonous effect that makes the writing less interesting to read.\n\nHere are a few tips for avoiding choppy sentences in your writing:\n\n1. Vary sentence length: Try to use sentences of different lengths to create a more natural rhythm. Use short sentences to make a point or emphasize an idea, but also use longer sentences to add complexity and depth to your writing.\n\n2. Use transitional words and phrases: Transitional phrases help to connect ideas and show how they relate to one another. These can include words like 'however,' 'therefore,' 'in addition,' and 'moreover.'\n\n3. Incorporate sentence variety: Mix up the types of sentences you use, including simple, compound, and complex sentences. This will help to create a more dynamic and interesting piece of writing. \n\n4. Read your writing out loud: When you read your writing out loud, you can more easily identify choppy sentences. If you notice that your sentence structure seems repetitive or monotonous, try rephrasing sentences or combining them for a smoother flow.\n\n5. Edit your work: After writing, go through and edit your work. Look for sentences that are too short or repetitive and make adjustments as needed.\n\nBy following these tips, you can avoid choppy sentences and create writing that is engaging and easy to read.",

They even say this military system of men's are one of the gender discriminatory. So, they say also women go to military like men's do. Is it right thinking? Is tihs true that military system is discriminatory about gender? I don't think so. Of course, it is hard to go military, but it can't be reason that military service should be expanded to encompass female Korean. This essay will explain some reasons that encourage my opinion.\n First, the problem of man's military service is not gender discrimination. It is just the problem of differences from men and women. In fact, men usually are stronger and have greater health. It is physical difference from men and women. The military, as you known as have a lot of time that exercise, training, etc. Some military's hard training is difficult to women to sucess that. Because of women's physical, the military service is hard to be expanded to women. Of course, there are some strong women that can work more that men. But this is not good in terms of efficiency.\n Also, there are some problems if the military service is expanded to Korean women. For example, the army must build new dormitary for women. Moreover, they have to prepare some place that need to wemen, like women's toilets, women's shower system, and also women's hospitals. Those preparing steps need a lot of moneys. This is not good for us.\n Lastly, because of women military service, the tax on military will increase. These days, already Korean have to pay lots of tax in military. If the military service is expanded on women, this military tax will be increased much more, and it makes us hard to live. The tax problem is not simple problem. The expanded military serviece lead to rebuild some dormitary and pay money to military women. These all the tax. Do you have enough money to pay it?\n To sum up, extending military service to women is not good for us because lots of money like tax and false asspect that military serviece of men is discrimination of gender. Men have their works, and also women. Men and women must care eash other. I hope you understanding my opinion. Thank you for reading my essay.",

        "response": " Some people in Korean question about military service. Why only men should go to military? Why only man spand their precious time in military? They even say this military system of men's are one of the gender discriminatory. So, they say also women go to military like men's do. Is it right thinking? Is tihs true that military system is discriminatory about gender? I don't think so. Of course, it is hard to go military, but it can't be reason that military service should be expanded to encompass female Korean. This essay will explain some reasons that encourage my opinion.\n First, the problem of man's military service is not gender discrimination. It is just the problem of differences from men and women. In fact, men usually are stronger and have greater health. It is physical difference from men and women. The military, as you known as have a lot of time that exercise, training, etc. Some military's hard training is difficult to women to sucess them. Because of women's physical weak, the military service is hard to be expanded to women. Of course, there are some strong women that can work more that men. But this is not good in terms of efficiency.\n Also, there are some problems if the military service is expanded to Korean women. For example, the army must build new dormitary for women. Moreover, they have to prepare some place that need to wemen, like women's toilets, women's shower system, and also women's hospitals. Those preparing steps need a lot of moneys. This is not good for us.\n Lastly, because of women military service, the tax on military will increase. These days, already Korean have to pay lots of tax in military. If the military service is expanded on women, this military tax will be increased much more, and it makes us hard to live. The tax problem is not simple problem. The expanded military serviece lead to rebuild some dormitary and pay money to military women. These all the tax. Do you have enough money to pay it?\n To sum up, extending military service to women is not good for us because lots of money like tax and false asspect that military serviece of men is discrimination of gender. Men have their works, and also women. Men and women must care eash other. I hope you understanding my opinion. Thank you for reading my essay.",

Articles are used to indicate whether a noun is specific or general. \n\n\"The\" is used when referring to a specific noun that has already been mentioned or is known to both the speaker and the listener. For example, \"The cat is sleeping on the couch.\" Here, \"the cat\" refers to a specific cat that has already been mentioned or is known to both the speaker and the listener.\n\n\"A\" is used when referring to a general noun that is not specific. For example, \"I saw a cat on the street.\" Here, \"a cat\" refers to any cat that the speaker saw on the street.\n\nIt's important to note that there are some exceptions and rules that govern the use of articles, and it can be a bit tricky to master.

Use more advanced vocabulary: Incorporate more advanced vocabulary words to demonstrate a higher level of language proficiency.

A relative pronoun is used to link two clauses that have a subject and a verb in both clauses.\n2. The most commonly used relative pronouns are 'who', 'whom', 'whose', 'that', and 'which'.\n3. 'Who' refers to people, while 'that' and 'which' refer to things or ideas.\n4. 'Whom' is also used for people, but it is more formal and not as commonly used anymore.\n5. 'Whose' is used to talk about possession, i.e., 'The man whose car was stolen'.\n6. There are times when 'that' can be used to talk about people, but it is often considered less formal than 'who' and should be avoided in formal writing.\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at your essay and see if we can identify any areas where you might need to adjust your use of relative pronouns. You can also incorporate examples of your own to show an understanding of the concept.",

If not, you will need to revise it to ensure that you are not using first or second person pronouns (I, me, my, we, us, our, you, your). \n\nNext, let's look at your use of outside sources. Have you included any sources to support your argument? If not, you will need to find credible sources to back up your claims. Make sure to properly cite your sources using the appropriate citation style (APA, MLA, etc.). \n\nOnce you have addressed these two areas, we can move on to the structure of your essay. Does your essay have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion? Is your thesis statement clear and concise? If not, you may need to revise your essay to ensure that it follows a logical structure and that your thesis statement is strong and supported by evidence. \n\nFinally, let's review your use of language and grammar. Are there any areas where you could improve your word choice or sentence structure? Are there any grammatical errors that need to be corrected?

If the government gave aid to every citizen, they would not be able to help everyone sufficiently. To provide assistance requires the recipients to also play their part by being in genuine need of help, as helping individuals who don't require assistance would detract from the aid provided to those who genuinely do need it.\nFirst, I think the government should provide sufficient help for people who need help because government help is critical for their lives. For example, if a poor man with no family got an accident and need money for the surgery nobody else could borrow him money except for the government. As shown in the example since the government has a permission to help every citizen to live a healthy and pleasure life. Helping only people in need would be a key to maintain the whole citizen live better lives.\nSecond helping for every citizen will make help for each person too small since the government has limited money and material. Perhaps nobody will be satisfied after getting such a small help. some might think it’s unfair to have only some people not everybody it is still the best choice to keep most people well as possible. \nThese are some reasons I think the government should help some people in need. By helping only people in need the government can use limited facility efficiently and people who need help we can get much more help than helping everyone in the society.\n\n",

        "response": "Thank you for providing your essay. Let's work through it together to make some improvements. \n\nFirst, let's work on the thesis statement. A thesis statement should clearly convey the essay’s main idea or argument. I would suggest revising your thesis statement to something like this: The government should only provide assistance to those in need because it ensures the government uses the limited resources efficiently and provides sufficient help for those who genuinely require it.\n\nNext, let's remove the first sentence of the first paragraph: \"I think the government should help only in need.\" Instead, you can start the paragraph by stating the main idea that you would like to discuss. For example: Government help is critical for individuals who require it.\n\nIn the second sentence of the first paragraph, you can reword the statement to have a more formal tone. For example: \"If assistance were to be given to every citizen, the government would be unable to provide sufficient help to those in genuine need.\"\n\nIn the first sentence of the second paragraph, you can start by using a transition word such as \"Firstly\" to signal to the reader that you are introducing the first point. However, you should reword the sentence to have a more formal tone. For example, you can say: \"The government should provide sufficient aid to those who require it because it is critical for their well-being.\"\n\nIn the second sentence of the second paragraph, you give an example to illustrate your point. However, the example could be clearer. You should refer to a real-life example that more accurately illustrates the point you are making. You could consider reworking this sentence to something like this: \"For instance, in the event that an individual who lacks financial resources and does not have anyone to turn to experiences a medical emergency, government aid would be their only option.\"\n\nThe third paragraph doesn't have any major grammar or spelling issues, but it could be clearer. You should start by introducing the second point with a transition word such as \"Secondly.\" Also, by using terms like \"some might think\" and \"perhaps,\" you weaken your argument. Instead, you should make a stronger statement that clearly states your opinion. For example: \"Assistance for every citizen would result in people receiving insignificant amounts of help that would fail to meet their needs.\"\n\nLastly, in the conclusion, you should summarize your main points without introducing any new information. You can also restate your thesis statement to bring the essay to a satisfying close.\n\nI hope these suggestions and feedback are helpful in revising your essay. Please let me know if you have any other questions.",

Prefixes and suffixes: Hyphens can be used to connect prefixes or suffixes to words, especially when the resulting word would be difficult to read without one.

For example, \"recovering alcoholic\" versus \"recovering from alcoholism.\"\n\n4. Numbers: Hyphens can indicate a range of numbers or be used to spell out numbers. For example, \"the years 2000-2009\" or \"seven-year-old child.\"\n\nIt's important to note that not all compound words require a hyphen, so it's important to check a dictionary or style guide to determine whether a particular word should be hyphenated or not.",

Body Paragraphs - the body paragraphs should present the similarities and differences between the two subjects. It's important to use clear and concise topic sentences that introduce each point, followed by evidence and examples to support the comparison or contrast.\n\n3. Conclusion - the conclusion should summarize the main points of the essay and restate the thesis statement.

Among the various types of trains available, the Mugungwha and the KTX are two of the most popular options. While both provide reliable transportation, there are significant differences between the two that make them suited to different needs.\n\nThe Mugungwha train is a conventional train that runs on a slower and more local route than the KTX. It is a cost-effective option for those who are looking to travel between cities and towns within the country. The train is popular among locals and budget-conscious travelers as it is cheaper than the KTX. It offers comfortable seating and a decent level of amenities, such as toilets, vending machines, and air conditioning.\n\nOn the other hand, the KTX is a high-speed train that travels at speeds of up to 350 kilometers per hour. It is a faster and more convenient option for those looking to travel between major cities, such as Seoul, Busan, and Daegu. The train is more expensive than the Mugungwha, but it offers a higher level of comfort and luxury. It has spacious seats, free Wi-Fi, and food service. Moreover, the KTX is punctual and reliable, making it an attractive option for business travelers and tourists who want to maximize their time in Korea.\n\nAnother difference between the Mugungwha and the KTX is the availability of routes. The Mugungwha train runs on more local routes, connecting small towns and cities. The KTX, on the other hand, runs on a limited number of routes, mainly connecting major cities.\n\nFurthermore, the KTX provides more flexibility for travelers with its different classes of service. First-class passengers can enjoy more spacious seating and a quiet, comfortable environment, while standard-class passengers can still enjoy a comfortable and efficient journey.\n\nIn conclusion, the Mugungwha and KTX trains in Korea are both efficient means of transportation, but they cater to different needs and preferences. The Mugungwha is a slower but more affordable option for travelers looking to explore more local destinations, while the KTX is a fast and luxurious option for those traveling between major cities.\n\nThis is my original essay.\n",

In the first sentence, I would suggest using \"connect\" instead of \"connecting,\" which would make the sentence flow better.\n\n2. In the first paragraph, \"budget-conscious travelers\" should have a hyphen to make it an adjective phrase.\n\n3. In the second paragraph, \"comfortable seating\" should be plural, as in \"comfortable seats.\"\n\n4. In the last paragraph, \"both\" should be changed to \"each\" to avoid repetition.\n\n5.

There were many news about the usage of taxes for people that needed help like old people who live alone or orphans. However, news also told that taxes are used at strange that people think they don’t need a help like rich people. Then, the taxes are used only for those most in need? I think it is not a good idea. I want to say three reasons for why government should help all of its citizens. First, everyone need help. Regardless of their background, people need help for many reasons. For example, these who are rich because of their restaurant. But if they have a problem about the pollution that is made by the building right next to restaurant, they can’t do anything regardless of their money. In this situation, government have to help them. Like this, regardless of their background, everyone needs help in their situation. Second, the government and the country is made by the citizens. At Korean law, it says ‘the right of Korea lies with the citizens, and all the power comes from the citizens.’ Citizens contribute to make a government and they should be the most important thing for the government. So, regardless of their background government have to protect all citizens. Finally, taxes are gained by all the citizens. Moreover, rich people pay more taxes. Of course I think it’s fair can common sense that rich people pay more taxes. But the fact is that all citizens pay taxes. It they pat it but there’s not any help, they will confused about why they pay taxes. So, government should help all people that pay taxes. To sum up, all citizen need help and they pay taxes for government. And also they are most important thing for the government. I think it is fair, that most taxes are used for people in need. But their system should be needed that all citizens can get help.",

According to the laws of Korea, \"the right of Korea lies with the citizens, and all the power comes from the citizens.\" Citizens have helped to create the government, and they should be the most important thing for the government.

But their system should be needed that all citizens can get help. \n\nHere are the corrections with proper comma usage:\n\nMany people wondered about how the government uses their taxes. There were many news about the usage of taxes for people that needed help like old people who live alone or orphans. However, news also told that taxes are used in ways that people think they don’t need, like rich people. Then, the taxes are used only for those most in need? I think it is not a good idea.\n\nI want to say three reasons for why the government should help all of its citizens. First, everyone needs help. Regardless of their background, people need help for many reasons. For example, those who are rich because of their restaurant. But if they have a problem about the pollution that is made by the building right next to restaurant, they can’t do anything regardless of their money. In this situation, the government has to help them. Like this, regardless of their background, everyone needs help in their situation.\n\nSecond, the government and the country are made by the citizens. At Korean law, it says ‘the right of Korea lies with the citizens, and all the power comes from the citizens.’ Citizens contribute to make a government, and they should be the most important thing for the government. So, regardless of their background, the government has to protect all citizens.\n\nFinally, taxes are gained by all the citizens. Moreover, rich people pay more taxes. Of course, I think it's fair and common sense that rich people pay more taxes. But the fact is that all citizens pay taxes. If they pay it but there's no help, they will be confused about why they pay taxes. So, the government should help all people that pay taxes.\n\nTo sum up, all citizen need help, and they pay taxes for government. And also, they are the most important thing for the government. I think it is fair that most taxes are used for people in need. But their system should be needed so that all citizens can get help.",

To support this argument, you use an example of a rich restaurant owner having a problem with pollution. However, this example doesn't quite fit with the argument. It's true that everyone needs help, but the pollution issue is not really about needing help. It's more about needing a solution to a problem that affects everyone. To make your point stronger, you could use a different example that is more clearly about someone in need of help.\n\nYour second argument is that the government should protect all citizens because the citizens are what make up the government. This is a good argument, but it is not clear how it supports your main point that the government should help all citizens. To make this connection clearer, you could explain how protecting citizens is the same as helping them.\n\nYour third argument is that all citizens pay taxes, and therefore the government should help all people who pay taxes. This is a strong argument, but you could make it stronger by providing more evidence or examples to support it. For example, you could explore how taxes are used in other countries, and how this compares to the way taxes are used in your country.\n\nIn conclusion, you have some great ideas in your essay, but you could strengthen your arguments and grounds by providing more specific evidence or examples to back up your points.

To support your argument that everyone needs help, you could provide examples of people from various backgrounds who have needed help at some point in their lives. For instance, you could discuss how people from different income levels face different challenges, such as poverty, medical expenses, or unemployment.\n\n2. To support your argument that the government should protect all citizens, you could provide examples of government programs or policies that work to protect people from harm or danger. For example, you could talk about regulations that protect workers from unsafe working conditions or laws that protect consumers from fraudulent business practices.\n\n3. To support your argument that all citizens pay taxes and should receive help, you could provide data or statistics that show how taxes are collected and distributed in your country. For example, you could discuss how taxes are divided into categories for education, healthcare, infrastructure, and social welfare programs. You can also provide examples of how government assistance programs have helped people in need in the past.\n\nRemember, when you use evidence or examples to support your arguments, it is important to make sure that they are relevant, accurate, and come from credible sources.",

There were many news about the usage of taxes for people that needed help like old people who live alone or orphans. However, news also told that taxes are used in ways that people think they don’t need, like rich people. Then, the taxes are used only for those most in need? I think it is not a good idea.  I want to say three reasons for why the government should help all of its citizens.\n First, everyone needs help. Regardless of their background, people need help for many reasons. For example, those who are rich because of their restaurant. But if they have a problem about the pollution that is made by the building right next to restaurant, they can’t do anything regardless of their money. In this situation, the government has to help them. Like this, regardless of their background, everyone needs help in their situation. Also, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many small business owners struggled to keep their businesses afloat, regardless of their financial status, highlighting the need for government support to protect businesses and the economy.\n Second, the government and the country are made by the citizens. At Korean law, it says ‘the right of Korea lies with the citizens, and all the power comes from the citizens.’ Citizens contribute to make a government, and they should be the most important thing for the government. So, regardless of their background, the government has to protect all citizens. Also, in the world, The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that \"all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights,\" highlighting the importance of protecting the rights and welfare of all citizens.\n Finally, taxes are gained by all the citizens. Moreover, rich people pay more taxes. Of course, I think it's fair and common sense that rich people pay more taxes. But the fact is that all citizens pay taxes. If they pay it but there's no help, they will be confused about why they pay taxes. So, the government should help all people that pay taxes.\n To sum up, all citizen need help, and they pay taxes for government. And also, they are the most important thing for the government. I think it is fair that most taxes are used for people in need. But their system should be needed so that all citizens can get help.",

There have been reports that taxes are put to good use to help elderly folks who live alone or orphans in need. However, taxes are also used for purposes that some people feel are unnecessary, like the wealthy. Should the government only spend taxes on those in need? This essay argues that the government should provide support to all its citizens for three reasons.\n\nFirst, everyone needs assistance at some point in their lives, irrespective of their status. For instance, a restaurant owner who is wealthy may be unable to do anything about the pollution caused by a building next to their restaurant. In such a scenario, the government must aid the individual. This illustrates that everyone requires help sometimes, regardless of their economic status. Additionally, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many small business owners struggled to keep their businesses afloat, reaffirming the necessity of government support to safeguard businesses and the economy.\n\nSecond, citizens are the foundation of the government and the country it serves. Korean law enshrines the principle that \"the power of Korea belongs to the people, and all power is derived from the people.\" As a result, citizens are the most important aspect of the government. This suggests that the government should protect all citizens, irrespective of their background. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights similarly recognizes that all humans are \"born free and equal in dignity and rights,\" emphasizing the importance of safeguarding the rights and well-being of all citizens.\n\nFinally, all citizens contribute to the generation of taxes, and the wealthy pay a greater percentage of taxes. While it is reasonable and fair that the wealthy pay more taxes, it is important to recognize that all citizens pay taxes. If they pay taxes but receive no assistance, they may become confused about why they contribute taxes. Therefore, the government should provide assistance to all taxpayers.\n\nIn conclusion, everyone requires assistance, pays taxes, and is essential to the government. It is reasonable to spend most taxes on individuals in need, but the system must be designed to assist all citizens.",

There were many news about the usage of taxes for people that needed help like old people who live alone or orphans. However, news also told that taxes are used in ways that people think they don’t need, like rich people. Then, the taxes are used only for those most in need? It is not a good idea.  This essay presents three reasons why the government should assist all of its citizens.\n First, everyone needs help. Regardless of their background, people need help for many reasons. For example, those who are rich because of their restaurant. But if a restaurant owner has a problem with the pollution caused by a neighboring building, they cannot do anything despite their wealth. In this situation, the government must assist them. Like this, regardless of their background, everyone needs help in their situation. Also, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many small business owners struggled to keep their businesses afloat, regardless of their financial status, highlighting the need for government support to protect businesses and the economy.\n Second, the government and the country are made by the citizens. At Korean law, it says ‘the right of Korea lies with the citizens, and all the power comes from the citizens.’ Citizens contribute to make a government, and they should be the most important thing for the government. So, regardless of their background, the government has to protect all citizens. Also, in the world, The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that \"all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights,\" highlighting the importance of protecting the rights and welfare of all citizens.\n Finally, taxes are gained by all the citizens. Moreover, rich people pay more taxes. It is reasonable and fair that the wealthy pay more taxes. But the fact is that all citizens pay taxes. If they pay it but there's no help, they will be confused about why they pay taxes. So, the government should help all people that pay taxes.\n To sum up, all citizen need help, and they pay taxes for government. And also, they are the most important thing for the government. Most taxes should be used to assist those in need, which is fair. But their system should be needed so that all citizens can get help.\n",

        "response": "Great job on your essay! You have presented a clear argument on why the government should assist all citizens. However, there are a few areas where you can improve your essay. Let's go through them step by step.\n\n1. Introduction: Your introduction is a good start, but it can be improved by adding a thesis statement. A thesis statement is a sentence that summarizes the main point of your essay. It should be clear and concise. For example, \"In this essay, I will argue that the government should assist all citizens, regardless of their background, because everyone needs help, citizens are the most important thing for the government, and taxes are gained by all citizens.\"\n\n2. Body Paragraphs: Your body paragraphs are well-organized and present strong arguments. However, there are a few areas where you can improve. Firstly, you need to provide evidence to support your arguments. For example, when you say that \"everyone needs help,\" you can provide examples of situations where people need help, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondly, you need to explain your arguments in more detail. For example, when you say that \"citizens are the most important thing for the government,\" you can explain why this is the case and provide evidence to support your argument.\n\n3. Conclusion: Your conclusion is a good summary of your essay, but it can be improved by restating your thesis statement and providing a final thought. For example, \"In conclusion, the government should assist all citizens because everyone needs help, citizens are the most important thing for the government, and taxes are gained by all citizens. By doing so, the government can ensure that all citizens are treated fairly and have access to the support they need.\"\n\nOverall, your essay is well-written, and you have presented a strong argument. By adding evidence, explaining your arguments in more detail, and restating your thesis statement in the conclusion, you can make your essay even stronger. Keep up the good work!",

Everyone needs help: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people lost their jobs and struggled to make ends meet. According to a report by the International Labour Organization, the pandemic has caused the equivalent of 255 million full-time jobs to be lost globally. This highlights the need for government support to help those who are struggling financially.\n\n2. Citizens are the most important thing for the government: According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, 64% of Americans believe that the government should be responsible for ensuring that all citizens have access to healthcare. This shows that citizens value the role of the government in providing essential services.\n\n3. Taxes are gained by all citizens: According to the Internal Revenue Service, in 2018, the top 1% of taxpayers paid 40.1% of all federal income taxes, while the bottom 50% paid just 3.1%. This highlights the fact that while the wealthy do pay more taxes, everyone contributes to the government's revenue.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

I have a few suggestions for revision to make it even stronger.\n\nFirst, I recommend starting with a clear thesis statement that directly answers the essay prompt. This will help guide your essay and make it more focused. For example, you could write: \"The government should provide assistance to all citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic background, because everyone needs help, citizens are the foundation of the government, and assisting all citizens can lead to economic benefits.\"\n\nNext, I suggest providing more specific examples to support your arguments. For instance, when you mention that everyone needs help, you could give more examples beyond the restaurant owner. You could also provide statistics or studies to back up your claims about economic benefits.\n\nAdditionally, I recommend addressing potential counterarguments. For example, some people might argue that the government should only help those most in need because resources are limited. You could acknowledge this argument and then explain why you still believe the government should assist all citizens.\n\nFinally, be sure to proofread your essay for grammar and spelling errors. This will help ensure that your ideas are communicated clearly and effectively.\n\nOverall, your essay has a strong foundation, and with a few revisions, it can become even more persuasive and compelling.

While taxes are often used to help those in need, such as the elderly or orphans, there are also instances where taxes are used in ways that some people may not agree with, such as benefiting the wealthy. This raises the question: should the government only help those most in need, or should it assist all citizens regardless of their socioeconomic background? This essay argues that the government should provide assistance to all citizens, as everyone needs help, citizens are the foundation of the government, and assisting all citizens can lead to economic benefits.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, the government has a responsibility to assist all citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic background. By doing so, the government can ensure that everyone has access to the help they need, and that citizens are treated equally and fairly. Furthermore, assisting all citizens can lead to economic benefits, such as job creation and increased consumer spending. While it is important to prioritize those most in need, the government should not neglect the needs of other citizens.

However, in Korea, almost all of universities make hard for student to change their major. Even, students try to re-enter other universities to change their major. So I think that universities should require that the first year of college be major-free. As I said before, there are many interesting things in these days. Although students have already chosen their major to study, ohter major can attract them so they can want to study other things. Someone can say that they can change their major, but if that two majors are completely different, students have to study much more new subjects so their graduation will be delayed. Even in KAIST, which is well known for easy major changing, they are afraid of changing major because their graduation could be delayed a lot. To prevent these problems, universities should make students select their major at least in second year of college. In KAIST, students are major-free in first year. they can study subjects of the major that they are interested in, though they're not in that major. They can test their interest about major, and they can consider whether they will be in the major or not. In this system, students will make less mistake to select their major and it will be decreased that students change their major. For these reasons, I believe universities shoud make their first year student be major-free.\n\n\tIs there any grammatical errors in my essay?",

However, in Korea, almost all of universities make it hard for students to change their major. Furthermore, students try to enroll in other universities to change their major. I think that universities should make the first year of college major-free.\n As I said before, there are many interesting things in these days. Although students have already chosen their major, they may still be interested in exploring other fields and subjects. It may be argued that students can change their major, but if that two majors are completely different, students have to study much more new subjects so their graduation will be delayed. Even in KAIST, which is well known for easy major changing, they are afraid of changing major because their graduation could be delayed a lot. To prevent these problems, universities should make students select their major at least in second year of college.\n In KAIST, students are major-free in first year. they can study subjects of the major that they are interested in, though they're not in that major. They can test their interest about major, and they can consider whether they will be in the major or not. In this system, students will make fewer mistake to select their major and it will be decreased that students change their major.\n For these reasons, I believe universities shoud make their first year student be major-free.\n can you find where i didn't follow the comma rule?\n",

First, the essay needs to have a clear introduction and a thesis statement that outlines the purpose of the essay. \n\nNext, let's move onto the use of proper grammar and punctuation. When a sentence begins with an introductory word, phrase or clause like \"these days\", \"for example\" or \"in my case\", use a comma to separate it from the rest of the sentence. Use a comma before the conjunction when joining two independent clauses with \"and\", \"but\", \"or\", \"yet\" and \"so\". \n\nLastly, try to avoid run-on sentences by breaking them up into smaller, more concise sentences. It makes the essay more readable and clear. \n\nCan you try to revise the essay again based on these rules and principles?",

However, as I read many articles, I found many people agree to help someone most need to be more careful from the government. I also think they should be targeted, but not only for them. Although they are overly weak, government should help all of its citizens.\n First, the budget that will used was initially for all of us. We all citizens are paying tax, and they shout out many complaints such as 'It is too expensive.' Even though, it is burden, they pay the tax for mandatory. Using the tax for all citizen is right. For this statement, helping only those most in need looks strange. It seems like the government overprotecting them. Majorities of citizens who are maintaining the country would feel bad to the government that only helping minorities.\n Second, the budget have to be used properly for functioning economy. There are many things government should get attention. For instance, monitoring and functioning school like KAIST or helping people who are poored. Then why they assist those things? It is for Country's power. Students in Kaist will lead science i th eworld, and structures will show the country's well. I want to point out that there are many things where budget should be used not only for poors.\n For these reasons, I think government should help all of citizens.

        "response": "Thank you for sharing your essay. \n\nFirst, let's go ahead and apply the comma rule for separating items in a list. In the second sentence of your essay, you could add a comma after the word \"controversial,\" as that signals to the reader that the sentence will contain two separate thoughts. Here is the revised sentence: \n\n\"It is quite controversial how much of people should be designated as socioeconomical poor, however, as I read many articles, I found many people agree to help someone most need to be more careful from the government.\"\n\nNext, let's review the usage of \"yet.\" In the last sentence, you have used \"yet\" correctly as you are showing a contrast - you believe government should help all citizens, yet they need to prioritize their assistance to those who are considered the poorest. \n\nNow, let's work on some sentence-level issues. In the third sentence, the phrase \"although they are overly weak\" is a bit unclear. Who or what is \"they\"? I think you might be referring to socioeconomically poor people, but the phrase isn't connected to a noun or pronoun that was referred to previously in the essay. Instead, consider adding a new sentence to clarify your thoughts. For example: \n\n\"Although socioeconomically poor people are considered the most vulnerable citizens in our society, I believe the government should help all of its citizens to ensure everyone has access to basic necessities and resources.\"\n\nIn the last paragraph, be sure to revise the sentence \"For these reasons, I think government should help all of citizens\" to say \"For these reasons, I think the government should help all of its citizens.\" Since you are referring to a specific government (i.e. the one of the country you are writing about), it is important to include the possessive pronoun \"its.\"\n\nFinally, I recommend reading through your essay again to catch any other typos, errors, or sentence fragments. Overall, your essay has a strong argument, but could benefit from some revisions to improve its clarity and flow. Good luck!",

Firstly, providing assistance to only one group of people can create a sense of unfairness among those who don’t receive the same benefits. This may create resentment and opposition from those who feel left out.\n\nSecondly, some people argue that this approach may create a culture of dependency, where people become reliant on government assistance and lose the motivation to work and improve their situation. This, in turn, may lead to an increase in welfare dependency and decrease the overall productivity and economic growth of the country.\n\nThirdly, some critics argue that government programs aimed at assisting the socioeconomically poor may be subject to fraud and abuse, which can lead to inefficiencies and waste of public resources. \n\nHowever, it should be noted that these arguments are based on a narrow view of the issue, and overlook the many benefits of providing assistance to those in need. When people are supported through government programs such as education, healthcare, and social safety nets, they are better able to achieve economic mobility, improve their quality of life, and become more productive members of society.",

This could be due to various reasons such as not being able to demonstrate their loss of income or not having prior registration with the government or relevant authorities. Selective payments may also be subject to errors, biases or corruption, particularly if the selection criteria or distribution mechanisms are not transparent or well-designed. Finally, some argue that selective payments may create social tensions or stigmas by distinguishing between “worthy” and “unworthy” recipients based on arbitrary criteria, rather than recognizing the broader solidarity and mutual support that are needed during a crisis.",

A well-planned budget can help a country maintain its economic stability, promote growth, and improve the quality of life for its citizens. \n\nFor example, investing in education can lead to a more skilled workforce, which can attract businesses and stimulate economic growth. Similarly, investing in infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, and public transportation can improve transportation efficiency, reduce traffic congestion, and increase access to goods and services. \n\nOn the other hand, if a country's budget is not distributed properly, it can lead to economic instability, social inequality, and political unrest. For instance, if too much of the budget is allocated to military spending, it can leave other important sectors underfunded, such as education, healthcare, and social welfare programs. This can lead to a lack of opportunities for citizens, which can cause frustration and unrest. \n\nTherefore, it's important for governments to carefully consider how they allocate their budgets to ensure that resources are distributed in a way that benefits the country as a whole.",

It is caused by the release of greenhouse gases from human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. To address this problem, we need to take immediate action. One way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to use renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Another way is to plant more trees, which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Additionally, we can reduce waste and conserve resources by recycling and using energy-efficient appliances. By taking these steps, we can help to mitigate the effects of global warming and protect the environment for future generations.\" \n\nIn this revised paragraph, the writer has improved the clarity and focus of their argument.

Helping those who are struggling due to circumstances such as illness or personal situations can have a positive impact on the individual's life and the society as a whole. However, over-helping can lead to a neglect of duty and cause social disparities. It is important to remember that someone who works and earns a lot of money should not be forced to \"sacrifice\" due to unfair mandates, and those deserving of assistance should be given the opportunities to succeed. By considering the individual's situation, the government can better support their citizens and create a more inclusive society.\n\nNow that we have a rough conclusion, make sure to read through and revise the conclusion as well as the rest of your essay.

In the second paragraph, instead of saying \"First,\" try starting the sentence with a transitional phrase like \"To begin with,\" or \"The first reason why...\" This will make your essay flow better. Additionally, try re-reading your sentences to make them more clear. For example, the sentence \"Even individuals who encounter challenging circumstances should be given equal opportunities to improve their situation through hard work\" could be rephrased as \"Individuals who face difficult circumstances should be provided with equal opportunities to improve their situation by working hard.\"\n\n3. In the third paragraph, it's important to explain why over-helping can lead to neglect of duty. Try expanding on this idea with an example or a specific scenario. Also, consider rephrasing the sentence \"This rule make strange society that faithful people live difficult life and lazy people live peaceful life.\" to make it more clear. For instance, it could be rephrased as \"This can create a society where hardworking individuals lead difficult lives in comparison to those who do not work.\"\n\n4. In the final paragraph, make sure to reiterate your thesis statement and follow it up with a clear conclusion. Consider wrapping up your essay by tying together all the points you've made and leaving the reader with something to think about.\n\nOverall, your essay has good ideas and potential, but it could benefit from clearer and more concise writing.

        "response": "Sure, here are some examples that you could use to support your second main idea:\n\n- In some cases, people who are wealthy or have connections may receive government assistance even if they don't truly need it. This can happen if they know how to work the system or have access to resources that others don't. This means that people who are truly in need may be denied assistance because the resources are being used by those who don't need them.\n- On the other hand, people who are truly in need may be denied assistance because they don't meet certain criteria or don't fit into a specific category. For example, someone who is struggling to make ends meet because of a medical condition may not qualify for assistance because they don't meet the income requirements, even though they are facing significant financial hardship.\n- Another issue with providing assistance based solely on economic status is that it can create a culture of dependency. If people know that they will receive assistance regardless of their efforts to improve their situation, they may be less motivated to work hard or take responsibility for their own lives. This can lead to a cycle of poverty and dependence that is difficult to break.\n- Finally, providing assistance based solely on economic status can be unfair to those who work hard and earn a good income. These individuals may be required to pay higher taxes or contribute more to social programs, even if they are already struggling to make ends meet. This can create resentment and a sense of injustice, which can lead to social unrest and division.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but you can use them as a starting point to develop your own ideas and arguments. Remember to provide specific examples and evidence to support your position, and to address counterarguments to your position.",

When I was growing up, my family struggled through tough financial times, and we often had to rely on government assistance to make ends meet. However, I noticed that those who were seemingly worse off than us were not always receiving aid. This made me question the fairness of the government's support system.

By doing so, those who truly need support can receive it, and those who are capable of standing on their own two feet can do so without hinderance. It is crucial to provide equitable assistance to those in need to ensure a just and fair society.

To revise your essay, we will need to go step by step and analyze each part of it. \n\nFirst, when it comes to presenting your arguments, you should make sure you have a clear thesis statement. This statement should clearly state your position on the topic of mandatory school uniforms. So, one potential thesis statement could be something like: \"I strongly believe that the mandatory wearing of school uniforms is essential in creating a positive school environment that supports the learning and growth of all students.\" \n\nOnce you have your thesis statement, you should then write out your main points. These points should support your thesis and show why you are taking this position. For example, you could argue that school uniforms promote a sense of unity and equality among students, that they help to create a more focused learning environment, or that they save parents money by eliminating the need for expensive clothing purchases. \n\nNext, we should look at the evidence you are using to support your arguments. You should make sure that any evidence you use is relevant, reliable, and credible. This means that you should use statistics, personal experiences, or research studies to support your claims. For example, you might back up your claim that school uniforms promote a sense of equality by citing research studies that show a decrease in bullying or the negative effects of clothing-based peer pressure. \n\nFinally, we should analyze your conclusion. This is where you should tie together all of your main points and restate your thesis statement in a clear and concise manner. Your conclusion should leave the reader with a clear understanding of your position and why it is important. \n\nSo, in summary, to revise your essay, we should examine your thesis statement, main points, evidence, and conclusion to make sure that everything is clear, relevant, and effectively supports your position.",

So, many people will be expected to lost their jobs. How can goverment help for this people? One of the solutions is giving them universal basic Income, which is called UBI. But, It's not a good option. The following will give a reason.\nUBI can be implemented in two main ways. One way is giving UBI every person in same amount, and the other is giving that differently based on income level. If goverment give UBI every person in the same amount, the product price will increase. Moreover, the money which goverment has will decreases, and the money have to be used in public policy will be insufficient. As a result, UBI can't ensure people's life quality. The other hand, UBI can be given differently based on income level. But, this leads to the other problems. Think about two people. One works hard to earn sufficient money for family, and the other does nothing. The person working hard would get less money than person do nothing. This removes the reason working hard, and It leads to decreasing productivity in society. In this respect, UBI can cause many side effects.\nIt can be also seen in terms of the efficient use of funds by the government. People who benefit from AI would earn many money by AI development. But the other lose their job. So, many amount of money would be bias to people who related with AI. However, the total amount of money is constant, so the government does not have to inject money into society. The proper role of the government is to establish policies to create jobs and encourage employment in society. In terms of having to use the government's limited money, UBI is a short-term solution. UBI has many risks to make it difficult to maintain society in the long run. For the reasons so far, UBI has many risks and side effects. More stable and sustainable solutions can be founded.

In this situation, one solution is considered which is universal basic income. However, this solution needs to be excluded because of many side effects and unsustainability. This essay will explore why UBI is not an appropriate solution and suggest things to consider in order to create better solution.\n     UBI can be implemented in two main ways. One way is giving UBI every person in same amount, and the other is giving that differently based on income level. If goverment give UBI every person in the same amount, the product price will increase. Moreover, the money which goverment has will decreases, and the money have to be used in public policy will be insufficient. As a result, UBI can't ensure people's life quality. The other hand, UBI can be given differently based on income level. But, this leads to the other problems. Think about two people. One works hard to earn sufficient money for family, and the other does nothing. The person working hard would get less money than person do nothing. This removes the reason working hard, and It leads to decreasing productivity in society. In this respect, UBI can cause many side effects.\n     It can be also seen in terms of the efficient use of funds by the government. People who benefit from AI would earn many money by AI development, but the other lose their job. As a result, many amount of money would be bias to people who related with AI. However, the government does not have to inject money into society because the total amount of money is constant. The proper role of the government is to establish policies to create jobs and encourage employment in society. \n     In terms of sustainability, UBI is a short-term solution. Therefore, UBI has many risks to make it difficult to maintain society in the long run. If UBI is started, it is difficult to decide when to stop this policy. There is a high possibility that UBI support will be decreased or stopped due to economic factors. And, such a situation would cause social and economic turmoil.\n     Since employment problem due to AI will get worse in the future as technology advances, the solution about that has to be sustainable and stable. But, UBI has many risks and side effects. Therefore, UBI should not be considered as a solution. More stable and sustainable solutions has to be founded to solve this problem.",

        "response": "Thank you for sharing your essay with me. You've presented some interesting arguments against the effectiveness of UBI as a solution to the problem of unemployment due to AI. However, there are a few things that you can improve to make your essay stronger. \n\nFirstly, you need to address some grammatical errors and typos, so make sure to proofread your essay before submitting. For example, you need to pay attention to capitalization, such as \"goverment,\" which should be \"government.\" You also have a misspelling in the second sentence, where \"stuided\" should be \"studied.\" \n\nSecondly, I suggest restructuring and reorganizing your paragraphs to make them more coherent and logical. You start with discussing the problem and then abruptly transition to discussing UBI's two ways of implementation. You should start with a clear introduction, then move to discussing the problem caused by AI, then dive into UBI and its issues. Also, consider combining some of your short paragraphs into longer, more comprehensive ones. \n\nLastly, your essay lacks supporting evidence and details, which makes your arguments less convincing. You should aim to add examples, statistics, or anecdotes, to back up your claims. For instance, when you claim that giving UBI to every person would lead to price increases, it would be useful to present some evidence that supports this argument, and explain why that is the case. \n\nOnce you have made these improvements, your essay will become much stronger and more engaging.

        "response": "Thank you for sharing your essay with me. Based on what we have learned in class about compare and contrast writing, there are a few areas in which your essay could be revised and refined. \n\nFirstly, when writing a compare and contrast essay, it's important to clearly state your thesis, which is your main argument or point. In your essay, it seems like your thesis is that UBI is not a suitable solution to the employment problem caused by AI. However, this thesis is not clearly stated in your introduction. I suggest you rephrase and clarify this thesis statement.\n\nSecondly, it is suggested that you organize your essay by either outlining the characteristics of each of the two topics (in this case, the benefits and drawbacks of UBI) and explaining the similarities and differences, or by exploring how each topic can or cannot be applied to a certain context. In your essay, the benefits and drawbacks of UBI are outlined as separate paragraphs, but they are not directly compared or contrasted with one another. Therefore, it might be helpful to compare each advantage with its corresponding weakness to provide logical support for your thesis.\n\nThirdly, it would help if you provided specific evidence and examples to support your arguments and show the reader how you arrived at your conclusions. At times, your writing appears vague, and using concrete examples will add strength to your arguments. For example, you mention that \"the government does not have to inject money into society because the total amount of money is constant,\" but you do not provide any evidence to validate this claim.\n\nLastly, it is advisable to rephrase or eliminate any sentences that are not clear or do not have a solid connection to your topic. For example, the first sentence of your second paragraph could benefit from some rephrasing to make it clearer. \n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful, and I encourage you to revise your essay while keeping these points in mind. Let me know if you have any questions or need more guidance during the revision process.",

This will help you see the structure of your essay and identify areas that need improvement.\n\n2. Group related ideas: Related ideas should be presented together in the same paragraph. Separate your paragraphs based on different points that you want to make, and include a clear topic sentence at the beginning of each paragraph to set the focus of the idea.\n\n3. Use transitions: Use transition words and phrases to help connect your paragraphs and make your argument flow logically. Some examples of transition words are: in addition, furthermore, however, on the other hand.\n\n4. Provide counterarguments: To strengthen your argument, include counterarguments in your essay and address them. This shows that you have considered different viewpoints and present a well-rounded argument. You can address counterarguments in a separate paragraph or include them in the paragraph where you present your point. \n\n5. Check the flow: Review the introduction and conclusion of your essay to ensure that they effectively present your argument, and are connected to the body of the essay. Ensure that the conclusion summarizes the main points and reinforces the thesis.\n\n6.

In this situation, one solution is considered which is universal basic income. However, this solution needs to be excluded because of many side effects and unsustainability. This essay will explore why UBI is not an appropriate solution and suggest things to consider in order to create better solution.\n     UBI can be implemented in two main ways. One way is giving UBI every person in same amount, and the other is giving that differently based on income level. If government give UBI every person in the same amount, the product price will increase. Moreover, the money which government has will decreases, and the money have to be used in public policy will be insufficient. As a result, UBI can't ensure people's life quality. The other hand, UBI can be given differently based on income level. However, this leads to the other problems. Think about two people. One works hard to earn sufficient money for family, and the other does nothing. The person working hard would get less money than person do nothing. This removes the reason working hard, and It leads to decreasing productivity in society. In this respect, UBI can cause many side effects.\n     It can be also seen in terms of the efficient use of funds by the government.

There is a high possibility that UBI support will be decreased or stopped due to economic factors. And, such a situation would cause social and economic turmoil.\n     Since employment problem due to AI will get worse in the future as technology advances, the solution about that has to be sustainable and stable.

In this situation, one solution is considered which is universal basic income. However, this solution needs to be excluded because of many side effects and unsustainability. This essay will explore why UBI is not an appropriate solution and suggest things to consider in order to create better solution.\n     UBI can be implemented in two main ways. One way is giving that every person in same amount, and the other is giving that differently based on income level. If the government gives UBI to every person in the same amount, the product price will increase.

On the other hand, That can be given differently based on income level. However, this leads to the other problems. Assume two people. One works hard to earn sufficient money for family, and the other does nothing. The person working hard would get less money than person do nothing.

There is a high possibility that UBI support will be decreased or stopped due to economic factors.

The first sentence of each paragraph is an excellent space to use transition words, just as you mentioned. Hence, try to integrate them into your essay.

        "response": "Certainly, I can provide an example for each paragraph:\n\n1. Introduction: Women's mandatory military enlistment is a topic that raises questions about physical and social differences between men and women. While some may argue that women should have equal opportunities when it comes to serving in the military, I believe that these differences cannot be ignored.\n\n2. Physical Differences: One of the primary considerations when it comes to the inclusion of women in the military is the significant gap in average muscle mass between men and women. According to studies, this gap is almost 20%, making it difficult to provide the same level of training for both genders. This means that women may be at a disadvantage when it comes to performing certain physical tasks required in the military.\n\n3. Crime in the Military: The military is no stranger to sexual assault and harassment. In fact, the military has been known to cover up such incidents, making it difficult for victims to report them. Recent statistics show that only 32.7% of sex crimes within the military are reported. This creates an environment where soldiers may not feel safe or protected.\n\n4. Facilities and Conditions: With women not being allowed in combat roles until recently, the facilities and conditions within the military are not suitable for women to join. There are shortages of women's toilets and other facilities that make it difficult for women to serve alongside men. These limitations serve as a significant barrier to women's participation in the military.\n\n5. Gender Equality: Some argue that women's mandatory military enlistment will help solve gender inequality and increase female participation in the military. However, simply allowing women to serve does not address systemic issues within society. Providing equal opportunities is only a small part of addressing gender inequality. It is a band-aid solution that fails to address the root causes of gender-based discrimination.\n\n6. Conclusion: In conclusion, I believe that women's mandatory military enlistment is not an effective solution to the issue of gender inequality within the military. Physical, social, and cultural differences between men and women cannot be ignored. Until facilities and conditions are equalized for both genders, women's participation in the military must remain voluntary.",

Start with an introduction that explains the issue at hand and provides some context regarding the topic. It should also include a thesis statement that outlines your position on the issue.\n\n2. In the next paragraph, start by addressing the point about physical differences between men and women. You should include evidence that supports your claim about the significant gap in average muscle mass between them. Provide some details about why this makes it challenging to provide the same level of training for both genders. \n\n3. In the following paragraph, address the issue of crime within the military, including sex crimes. You should provide more examples of how the military has been known to cover up such incidents and why soldiers might not report them. \n\n4. In the next paragraph, provide evidence that facilities and conditions cannot accommodate female soldiers entering the military. Include examples of shortages of women's toilets or other facilities that make it difficult for women to serve alongside men. Be sure to explain how these conditions serve as a barrier to women's participation in the military.\n\n5. Address the counterargument that women's mandatory military enlistment will help solve gender inequality, and why you think it is not a fundamental solution. Provide supporting evidence to explain why you believe such claims are false or unsupported.\n\n6. In the conclusion, summarize your key arguments and restate your thesis. Make it clear why you support your position on this issue.\n\nRemember to proofread your work and make sure your sentences are clear, concise, and logical. Also, do not forget to verify your sources and include your references wherever necessary. Good luck, and please let me know if you have any questions.",

        "response": "Certainly, I can provide an example for each paragraph:\n\n1. Introduction: Women's mandatory military enlistment is a topic that raises questions about physical and social differences between men and women. While some may argue that women should have equal opportunities when it comes to serving in the military, I believe that these differences cannot be ignored.\n\n2. Physical Differences: One of the primary considerations when it comes to the inclusion of women in the military is the significant gap in average muscle mass between men and women. According to studies, this gap is almost 20%, making it difficult to provide the same level of training for both genders. This means that women may be at a disadvantage when it comes to performing certain physical tasks required in the military.\n\n3. Crime in the Military: The military is no stranger to sexual assault and harassment. In fact, the military has been known to cover up such incidents, making it difficult for victims to report them. Recent statistics show that only 32.7% of sex crimes within the military are reported. This creates an environment where soldiers may not feel safe or protected.\n\n4. Facilities and Conditions: With women not being allowed in combat roles until recently, the facilities and conditions within the military are not suitable for women to join. There are shortages of women's toilets and other facilities that make it difficult for women to serve alongside men. These limitations serve as a significant barrier to women's participation in the military.\n\n5. Gender Equality: Some argue that women's mandatory military enlistment will help solve gender inequality and increase female participation in the military. However, simply allowing women to serve does not address systemic issues within society. Providing equal opportunities is only a small part of addressing gender inequality. It is a band-aid solution that fails to address the root causes of gender-based discrimination.\n\n6. Conclusion: In conclusion, I believe that women's mandatory military enlistment is not an effective solution to the issue of gender inequality within the military. Physical, social, and cultural differences between men and women cannot be ignored. Until facilities and conditions are equalized for both genders, women's participation in the military must remain voluntary.",

In other words, only 3 out of 10 people report it. 44% of victims who did not report sex crimes saids, \"No action was likely to be taken.\" In other words, soldiers do not trust the military's measures and do not even expected them. Unlike now situation, if two genders have to live in the military, there might be many problems that comes from the difference of two genders in the closed military society. As a result, the crime can be increased. \nMoreover, joining women to the military cannot resolve gender inequality.

Of course, it is a pity that men go to the military to support their youth in their young and precious days in their 20s. I think women should live with more respect for men and a heart that contributes to the country.",

Let's go through each paragraph and see how we can revise them to make your argument stronger.\n\nIn the first paragraph, you have a good thesis statement that presents your argument against women's mandatory military enlistment. However, you can improve it by including an opposing point of view. For example, you can rewrite it as follows:\n\nWhile some argue that women should have equal opportunities to serve in the military, others believe that physical and social differences between men and women cannot be ignored. Despite the fact that women have made significant strides in breaking down gender barriers, the inclusion of women in the military raises questions about their ability to perform certain physical tasks required in the military.\n\nIn the second paragraph, you provide statistics about sexual assault and harassment in the military. However, you can improve this paragraph by using transition signals of contrast to include an opposing point of view. For example, you can rewrite it as follows:\n\nAlthough the military has made efforts to address sexual assault and harassment, recent statistics show that only 32.7% of sex crimes within the military are reported. While some argue that mandatory military enlistment for women will help address this issue, others believe that it may create an environment where soldiers do not feel safe or protected.\n\nIn the third paragraph, you argue that the inclusion of women in the military cannot resolve gender inequality. However, you can improve this paragraph by using transition signals of contrast to include an opposing point of view. For example, you can rewrite it as follows:\n\nWhile some argue that women's mandatory military enlistment will help solve gender inequality and increase female participation in the military, others believe that it is a band-aid solution that fails to address the root causes of gender-based discrimination. Although providing equal opportunities is important, it is only a small part of addressing gender inequality.\n\nIn the final paragraph, you restate your thesis statement and provide a conclusion. However, you can improve this paragraph by using transition signals of contrast to include an opposing point of view. For example, you can rewrite it as follows:\n\nWhile some argue that women's participation in the military should be mandatory, I believe that physical, social, and cultural differences between men and women cannot be ignored. Until facilities and conditions are equalized for both genders, women's participation in the military must remain voluntary. Although it is important to support our country, we must also consider the well-being and safety of our soldiers.\n\nOverall, your essay is well-written, and you have presented a strong argument against women's mandatory military enlistment. By using transition signals of contrast, you can include an opposing point of view and make your argument stronger. Keep up the good work!",

        "response": "With the development of the internet, online shopping has become increasingly popular, challenging the traditional offline shopping way. This essay is going to compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of online shopping and offline shopping, considering factors such as convenience, variety, interaction, and overall impact on consumers.\nOne of the key advantages of online shopping is convenience and accessibility. With just a few researching, consumers can browse through a vast array of products and make purchases from the comfort of their own homes. Online shopping eliminates the need for physical travel to stores, saving time and effort. Moreover, online shopping allows shoppers to make purchases at any time they want, as they are typically open 24/7. On the other hand, offline shopping provides an immediate shopping. Shoppers can physically examine and try on products before making a purchase, which is not possible with online shopping. Also, offline shopping offers instant gratification, as consumers can immediately take their purchases home. But, in a different sense, offline shopping requires individuals to visit physical stores during their operating hours, which can be restrictive and inconvenient for those with busy schedules.\nNext, Online shopping offers unparalleled variety and selection. E-commerce platforms provide access to products from all around the world, allowing consumers to explore a wide range of options. Online retailers often have extensive inventories, ensuring that shoppers can find products in various sizes, colors, and styles. Also, consumers can easily compare prices, read reviews, and access detailed product information, empowering them to make informed purchasing decisions. In contrast, offline shopping have limited stock and selection, especially in smaller or specialized stores. But offline shopping also have merits in providing the opportunity for consumers to personally inspect products and assess their quality, something that online shopping lacks. Shoppers can touch, feel, and try on items, ensuring their quality, fit, and suitability. This hands-on experience is particularly valuable for items such as clothes, furniture, or electronics. On the contrary, online shopping relies on product descriptions, image, and sometimes customer reviews, which may not always accurately convey the real-life experience of the product.\nIn addition, interaction and customer service also differ between online and offline shopping. Offline stores provide face-to-face interaction with sales associates who can provide personalized assistance, answer questions, and offer recommendations. This personalized interaction enhances the shopping experience and can help customers make informed purchasing decisions. Offline shopping also provides the opportunity for social interaction, allowing shoppers to engage with friends or family while browsing stores. Online shopping, on the other hand, relies on digital communication channels. Even though customer service is available through online chat or email, the absence of immediate assistance may lead to delays in resolving queries or concerns.\nNext is about price comparison. Price comparison is an area where both online and offline shopping have their merits. Online retailers often offer competitive prices due to lower overhead costs, and the ability to compare prices across different platforms is a breeze. In comparison, offline shopping can involve bargaining, taking advantage of sales or discounts, and immediate price negotiations, especially in smaller or local stores. Additionally, offline shopping allows shoppers to avoid shipping costs or waiting periods, which can sometimes be associated with online purchases.\nIn terms of the overall impact on consumers, shopping experience and returns differs significantly between online and offline shopping. Online shopping offers a convenient and efficient experience, allowing consumers to quickly find products and compare prices. It has provided opportunities for small business and entrepreneurs to reach a wider market. However, it has led to concerns such as cybersecurity risks, potential frauds, and the loss of in-person social interaction. Also, it lacks the sensor experience that offline shopping provides, such as physically touching and trying on items. Offline shopping, while more traditional, still holds its value in terms of personal engagement, immediate gratification, and the ability to support local businesses. Offline shopping offers an immersive experience, allowing shoppers to engage their senses and assess product quality firsthand. Another aspect to consider is the return process. Online shopping often provides hassle-free return, with easy-to-follow procedures and prepaid shipping labels. In contrast, returning items purchased offline may require visiting the store, waiting in line, and complying with specific return policies.\nIn conclusion, online shopping and offline shopping both have their advantages and disadvantages. Online shopping offers convenience, a extensive variety of products, competitive prices, and the ability to shop anytime anywhere. On the other hand, offline shopping provides the opportunity for sensory engagement, face-to-face interaction between customers and staff, personalized customer service, and immediate gratification. Ultimately, the choice between online shopping and offline shopping depends on individual preferences, the type of product being purchased, and the overall shopping experience desired. As technology continues to advance, the future may see a blending of these two approaches, providing an even more seamless and immersive shopping experience for consumers.",

Shoppers can touch, feel, and try on items, ensuring their quality, fit, and suitability. This hands-on experience is particularly valuable for items such as clothes, furniture, or electronics. On the contrary, online shopping relies on product descriptions, image, and sometimes customer reviews, which may not always accurately convey the real-life experience of the product.\nIn addition, interaction and customer service also differ between online and offline shopping. Offline stores provide face-to-face interaction with sales associates who can provide personalized assistance, answer questions, and offer recommendations. This personalized interaction enhances the shopping experience and can help customers make informed purchasing decisions. Offline shopping also provides the opportunity for social interaction, allowing shoppers to engage with friends or family while browsing stores. Online shopping, on the other hand, relies on digital communication channels. Even though customer service is available through online chat or email, the absence of immediate assistance may lead to delays in resolving queries or concerns.\nNext is about price comparison. Price comparison is an area where both online and offline shopping have their merits. Online retailers often offer competitive prices due to lower overhead costs, and the ability to compare prices across different platforms is a breeze. In comparison, offline shopping can involve bargaining, taking advantage of sales or discounts, and immediate price negotiations, especially in smaller or local stores. Additionally, offline shopping allows shoppers to avoid shipping costs or waiting periods, which can sometimes be associated with online purchases.\nIn terms of the overall impact on consumers, shopping experience and returns differs significantly between online and offline shopping. Online shopping offers a convenient and efficient experience, allowing consumers to quickly find products and compare prices. It has provided opportunities for small business and entrepreneurs to reach a wider market. However, it has led to concerns such as cybersecurity risks, potential frauds, and the loss of in-person social interaction. Also, it lacks the sensor experience that offline shopping provides, such as physically touching and trying on items. Offline shopping, while more traditional, still holds its value in terms of personal engagement, immediate gratification, and the ability to support local businesses. Offline shopping offers an immersive experience, allowing shoppers to engage their senses and assess product quality firsthand. Another aspect to consider is the return process. Online shopping often provides hassle-free return, with easy-to-follow procedures and prepaid shipping labels. In contrast, returning items purchased offline may require visiting the store, waiting in line, and complying with specific return policies.\nIn conclusion, online shopping and offline shopping both have their advantages and disadvantages. Online shopping offers convenience, a extensive variety of products, competitive prices, and the ability to shop anytime anywhere. On the other hand, offline shopping provides the opportunity for sensory engagement, face-to-face interaction between customers and staff, personalized customer service, and immediate gratification. Ultimately, the choice between online shopping and offline shopping depends on individual preferences, the type of product being purchased, and the overall shopping experience desired. As technology continues to advance, the future may see a blending of these two approaches, providing an even more seamless and immersive shopping experience for consumers.",

        "response": "Great job on your essay! Let's work on revising it based on the advice I gave you.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at your introductory paragraph. You have a clear thesis statement at the end that tells the reader what the essay is going to compare. However, it would be helpful to add a sentence or two that provides some background information on the topic and why it is important to compare and contrast online and offline shopping.\n\nNext, let's focus on the body paragraphs. You are using point-by-point organization to discuss similarities and differences. However, it would be helpful to add transition sentences between each point to help the reader follow your argument more easily.\n\nFinally, let's take a look at your conclusion. You do a good job of summarizing the main points, but it would be helpful to add a sentence or two that provides some final thoughts on the topic and why it is important to consider both online and offline shopping.\n\nHere is a revised version of your essay:\n\nWith the development of the internet, online shopping has become increasingly popular, challenging the traditional offline shopping way. In this essay, we will compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of online shopping and offline shopping, considering factors such as convenience, variety, interaction, and overall impact on consumers.\n\nOnline shopping offers convenience and accessibility. With just a few clicks, consumers can browse through a vast array of products and make purchases from the comfort of their own homes. Online shopping eliminates the need for physical travel to stores, saving time and effort. Moreover, online shopping allows shoppers to make purchases at any time they want, as they are typically open 24/7. On the other hand, offline shopping provides an immediate shopping experience. Shoppers can physically examine and try on products before making a purchase, which is not possible with online shopping. Also, offline shopping offers instant gratification, as consumers can immediately take their purchases home. However, offline shopping requires individuals to visit physical stores during their operating hours, which can be restrictive and inconvenient for those with busy schedules.\n\nNext, online shopping offers unparalleled variety and selection. E-commerce platforms provide access to products from all around the world, allowing consumers to explore a wide range of options. Online retailers often have extensive inventories, ensuring that shoppers can find products in various sizes, colors, and styles. Also, consumers can easily compare prices, read reviews, and access detailed product information, empowering them to make informed purchasing decisions. In contrast, offline shopping has limited stock and selection, especially in smaller or specialized stores. However, offline shopping also has merits in providing the opportunity for consumers to personally inspect products and assess their quality, something that online shopping lacks. Shoppers can touch, feel, and try on items, ensuring their quality, fit, and suitability. This hands-on experience is particularly valuable for items such as clothes, furniture, or electronics. On the contrary, online shopping relies on product descriptions, images, and sometimes customer reviews, which may not always accurately convey the real-life experience of the product.\n\nIn addition, interaction and customer service also differ between online and offline shopping. Offline stores provide face-to-face interaction with sales associates who can provide personalized assistance, answer questions, and offer recommendations. This personalized interaction enhances the shopping experience and can help customers make informed purchasing decisions. Offline shopping also provides the opportunity for social interaction, allowing shoppers to engage with friends or family while browsing stores. Online shopping, on the other hand, relies on digital communication channels. Even though customer service is available through online chat or email, the absence of immediate assistance may lead to delays in resolving queries or concerns.\n\nPrice comparison is an area where both online and offline shopping have their merits.

In comparison, offline shopping can involve bargaining, taking advantage of sales or discounts, and immediate price negotiations, especially in smaller or local stores.

        "response": "Great! It sounds like you've got a good handle on one of the most basic comma rules. Let's see if you can apply that rule to your essay. \n\nFirst, look through your essay and identify places where you have lists of two or more elements. Once you've found them, make sure that you have used commas to separate those elements. \n\nIf you haven't used commas, add them in where necessary. For example:\n\nOriginal: On my trip I visited Paris London and Rome.\n\nRevised: On my trip, I visited Paris, London, and Rome.\n\nIf you have used commas, double-check that you've used them correctly. Remember that there should be a comma between each element in the list, and the final element should also be followed by a comma before the coordinating conjunction (e.g. and, or).\n\nOnce you're done with that step, look over your essay again to make sure that there are no places where you've used a comma incorrectly. For example:\n\nOriginal: I went to the store, to get some milk.\n\nRevised: I went to the store to get some milk.\n\nIn this case, the comma is unnecessary and should be removed.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, and we can work through them together.",

Nowadays, however, lots of students including high school students, university students doesn’t have to take their loads like textbooks. They just take their laptop or tablet. Almost students of KAIST already have their own laptop of tablet, or both. Why many people use that in class? Let me explain why laptop/tablet are more convenient than textbooks and pens. First of all, it is light. Things which are light have many advantages. It is less hand to pick light things than heavy things. Because of this reason, It is convenient to take whenever students go. Second, laptop and tablet doesn’t have limit to include infinite files that are helpful to lessons or their own study. For example, lots of students use PDF when they study or listen their lectures. PDF helps students not to take various textbooks when they have various lectures on only one day. Lastly, it can increase students’ academic achievements. Specifically, just writing using their own hands have limit to write fastly. But typing using laptop is faster than hand writing. In addition, laptop and tablet can search internet like Google. Therefore, whenever students doesn’t know any informations that are important to understand their class, they can search the information by using tablet and laptop. When students sumit their homeworks to professor, laptop and tablet are convenient, because offline sumit request more time, more effort than online sumit. In short, laptop and tablet have many advantages like weigh(for portability), infinite saving space, and increasing students’ academic achievements.\n",

Break up large paragraphs: Your paragraph is quite lengthy and contains several different ideas. Consider breaking it up into shorter paragraphs to make it easier for your reader to follow your train of thought.\n\n2. Use transitional phrases: Use transitional phrases to connect your ideas better. Begin a new paragraph with signals like \"to begin with,\" \"in addition,\" \"second,\" or \"finally\" which will help the reader to understand how the different ideas relate to each other.\n\n3. Watch your grammar: Several places in your essay have varying verb tense. Be sure to keep the verb tense consistent within each sentence.\n\nHere is a suggested revision of your paragraph, showing how it can be broken up into shorter paragraphs with transitional phrases added to help connect your ideas:\n\nNowadays, economic inequality has become a serious problem in the world. According to the Oxfam report, only 26 richest people collectively own more wealth than the poorest 50% of the global population. In addition to income inequality, gender inequality, and education inequality have become more severe. In this situation, most people have different levels of socioeconomic backgrounds.

Given that the wealthiest people own almost all of the resources, if the government helps all of the citizens, then economic inequality will get worse. The government should focus instead on prioritizing the redistribution of wealth and resources to support those who are vulnerable.\n\nSecond, wealthy individuals do not feel that they need the government's help to the same degree as those with less wealth. According to ChatGPT, they are primarily interested in government policies and regulations that can affect them - such as tax policies and trade policies. Wealthy people may even have a motivation to support community help programs, understanding that societal inequality and unfairness may lead to unsustainable and unstable civilizations. Therefore, the government does not need to help wealthy people, and these individuals may even agree with this idea.\n\nSome people might think that this approach could create another kind of inequality. However, such an inequality can be helpful to our society, as it allows more resources to be allocated towards people with the most need.\n\nIn conclusion, the government does not need to help all citizens, in light of resource limitations and wealth redistribution concerns, as well as wealthy support of other community programs. Instead, the government should focus on helping those most in need to reduce inequality in our society.",

        "response": "Great job on writing your essay! Your argument is well-organized and persuasive, and you made some excellent points to support your position. However, there is some room for improvement in terms of grammar, style, and clarity. Here is a step-by-step guide that will help you revise your essay:\n\n1. First of all, let's work on your thesis statement. The thesis statement should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. A good thesis statement should summarize the main idea of your essay. In your case, here's a possible revision for your thesis statement:\n\n\"Requiring universities to offer a major-free first year can help students make more informed decisions about their majors, as the high school education system in Korea provides inadequate preparation for students to make effective choices.\"\n\n2. Let's move on to reviewing your body paragraphs. Each paragraph should begin with a topic sentence that introduces the main idea of the paragraph. In the first paragraph, you argued that high school curriculums do not provide students with enough knowledge to select a major. Here's a revision to your topic sentence:\n\n\"High school curriculums in Korea do not offer students sufficient information to make informed decisions about their majors, which can have a significant impact on their future paths.\"\n\n3. In the next paragraph, you mentioned that having a major-free first year can help students find their interests. Here's a revision to your topic sentence:\n\n\"By offering a major-free first year, universities can provide students with the opportunity to explore different fields of study and discover their true passions.\"\n\n4. Finally, let's work on your conclusion paragraph. Your conclusion should restate your thesis statement and summarize your main points. Here is a possible revision to your conclusion:\n\n\"In conclusion, the Korean education system's shortcomings make it difficult for students to select a major effectively. Therefore, universities should implement a mandatory major-free first year to help students make more informed choices. By providing students with a variety of options and allowing them to explore different fields of study, universities can help students find their true passions.\" \n\nI hope this feedback has been useful.

Use transitions to connect your ideas: Your essay jumps from one idea to the next without much connection between them. Using transitions can help your essay flow more smoothly and make it easier for the reader to follow your argument.\n\n4. Consider the counterargument: It's always a good idea to consider the counterargument and address it in your essay.

Addressing this argument can strengthen your overall argument.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful! Let me know if you have any questions or need further guidance.",

In conclusion, the Korean education system has several problems, especially in high school, which makes it difficult for students to choose their majors effectively. Therefore, universities should require the first year of college to be major-free to help students make a more informed decision about their future.\" \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if you would like me to revise any other parts of your essay.",

        "response": "Great job on your essay! Here are some suggestions for revision:\n\n1. Clarify your thesis statement: Your thesis statement is the most important part of your essay, as it tells the reader what your argument is. In your essay, you state that universities should require the first year of college to be major-free, but you don't clearly state why. Try to rephrase your thesis statement to make it more specific and clear.\n\n2. Provide more evidence: While you make some good points in your essay, you could strengthen your argument by providing more evidence to support your claims. For example, you mention that high school curriculums don't provide enough knowledge for students to select a major, but you don't provide any specific examples or statistics to back up this claim. Try to find some research or data to support your argument.\n\n3. Use more specific language: In some places, your essay uses vague or general language that could be more specific. For example, you say that students need to learn a variety of subjects, but you don't specify which subjects or why they are important. Try to be more specific in your language to make your argument more persuasive.\n\n4. Consider counterarguments: To make your argument stronger, it's important to consider counterarguments and address them in your essay. For example, some people might argue that a major-free first year of college would be a waste of time and money. Try to anticipate these counterarguments and address them in your essay.\n\nOverall, your essay has a strong argument and some good points, but it could be improved with more specific language, more evidence, and a clearer thesis statement. Keep up the good work!",

Your essay is well-structured and presents a clear argument for why universities should require the first year of college to be major-free. You provide good reasons to support your argument and use an example from your own university to illustrate your point. However, there are a few areas where you could improve your essay. \n\nFirst, you could provide more specific examples to support your argument. For instance, you mention that high school curriculums don't provide enough knowledge for students to select a major, but you don't provide any specific examples of what students are missing. Adding specific examples would make your argument more persuasive.\n\nSecond, you could address potential counterarguments to your position. For example, some people might argue that a major-free first year would delay students' progress towards graduation. You could address this counterargument by explaining how a major-free first year could actually help students graduate more quickly by allowing them to choose a major that they are truly interested in.\n\nOverall, your essay is well-written and presents a strong argument. With a few revisions, it could be even stronger.",

The examples and the reasons are written below.\n\nFirst, if the government helps all its citizens not concerning socioeconomic background, the whole tax burden will increase. Because the number of people the government should help increase when compared with situation when the government only help the poor one, all of the citizens should pay more tax. And by increases tax, the poor one will happen to be more poor even if the government help them.\n\nSecond, it government help all the citizens, their motivation to work will decrease. Even if people don't work, the government will give money or food to all the citizens, and then there is no reason to work, because the government will always help them. And ig people don't work, the society won't work, and of course there won't be the money, made by tax, that is used to help the citizens.\n\nFor last, when considered realistically, there won't be enough resources to help all the people in the society. Of course it would be nice if everyone can receive support from the government. But that is impossible in our lives. Even though we have the resources and use it to help all the people in the government, that will make the one who desperately need the resource unable to get that resource. And that makes society more polarized.\n\nOverall, providing government help to all of its citizens regardless of their socioeconomic background will withdraw many social. economic problems that we must think about carefully. Though it is right that everyone should be able to be helped at the time they need, but it is also crucial to use limited resources where they are really needed.",

Let's start with the first paragraph:\n\n- You wrote, \"The government should help only those most in need, because if not, it can lead to some potential problems.\" This sentence is incomplete and should be revised to, \"The government should help only those most in need, because if it helps everyone regardless of their socioeconomic background, this could lead to some potential problems.\"\n\nNow let's tackle the faulty parallelism in the second paragraph:\n\n- You wrote, \"Even if people don't work, the government will give money or food to all the citizens, and then there is no reason to work, because the government will always help them.\" The second clause (\"and then there is no reason to work, because the government will always help them\") does not match the structure of the first clause (\"Even if people don't work, the government will give money or food to all the citizens\"). To make the sentence parallel, you can revise it to, \"Even if people don't work, the government will give money or food to all the citizens, which could lead to decreased motivation to work, as people may believe they do not need to work since the government will always help them.\"\n\nNow let's address the faulty comparison in the third paragraph:\n\n- You wrote, \"Of course it would be nice if everyone can receive support from the government. But that is impossible in our lives.\" This is a faulty comparison because there is no comparison being made. To make this comparison clear, you can revise it to, \"Of course, it would be nice if everyone could receive support from the government. However, it is impossible to provide support to all citizens, given the limited resources available.\"\n\nLastly, let's revise the concluding paragraph:\n\n- You wrote, \"Overall, providing government help to all of its citizens regardless of their socioeconomic background will withdraw many social. economic problems that we must think about carefully.\" This sentence is a bit unclear and could use some revisions for clarity. To make the sentence clear, you can revise it to, \"Overall, while it may seem ideal to provide government help to all citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic background, doing so can lead to numerous social and economic problems. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider which individuals truly require government assistance and allocate resources accordingly.\"\n\nRemember to proofread your essay thoroughly after making these revisions. Great job! Let me know if you have any questions.",

        "response": "Majority of people may have experienced to wear their school uniform. This traditional thought that students should wear school uniform may last very long time, even for these days. However, recently there are some schools which allow students to wear free clothes when they go to school. Of course freedom of students is important, but I think that high school should control student's clothes and they should wear constant clothes as school uniform. There are two big reasons that I asserts with this statement.\nFirstly, wearing school uniform is very economical. It is needless to say that young people are usually interested in fashion or trend. So they buy new clothes or accessories that are famous for their friends. For example, in 2000s, there were some students so-called \"backbone broker\" in South Korean that required a kind of expensive jackets such as \"Goose down\" for their parents. If high school control students to wear school uniform, students do not have to buy expensive and high-quality clothes to wear in school. Moreover, It is worth pointing that as they wear school uniform for 5 days a week, they don't need large amount of clothes on daily life. As I pointed out, wearing school uniform can reduce payment on clothes, so it is economical.\nSecondly, I would like to say that school uniform is able to represent school's identity. Obviously, once school uniform select for specific school, usually it would not change for very long term. In other words, many people who graduated those school wore the school uniform. The point is that such school uniform could be a symbol of school. For instance, if you walk along that street and see some students wearing school uniform, you could recognize the name of school students are in. Furthermore, wearing school uniform may integret student's mind, because it provide same design for all of students. I think that school uniform is capable of making an image and identity of each school.\nIn conclusion, wearing school uniform is helpful in reducing economcal burden. Also, it could make a kind of identity in school. Thus, I think that school uniform should be required for high school students.",

In the first sentence you may consider adjusting the verb to match the subject. \"Majority of people\" is singular, so the correct verb form would be \"has experienced,\" rather than \"have.\"\n2. You may consider using parallel structure in the second sentence. Instead of saying \"This traditional thought that students should wear school uniform,\" you could say \"The traditional notion that students should wear school uniforms has persisted for a long time, even today.\"\n3. In the second paragraph, you may want to adjust the subject-verb agreement in the second sentence. Instead of using \"I asserts,\" use \"I assert\" since \"I\" is singular. Also, \"with this statement\" at the end of the sentence seems redundant - consider omitting it.\n4. In the third paragraph, you may consider adjusting \"schools uniform\" to \"school uniforms\" for subject-verb agreement, and adding an article like \"the\" before \"specific school.\"\n5. Lastly, you may want to adjust the conclusion sentence to use \"is\" instead of \"should be\" to maintain consistent tense with the rest of the essay.\n\nSo let's begin the revision process together.\n \nFirst and foremost, can you implement the above suggestions I provided for the first and second paragraphs?",

        "response": "Great! Good use of transitions can significantly improve the flow and coherence of your essay. Let's get started with the revision process. \n\n1. First, go through your essay and identify the areas where you have not used any transitions at all or where there are weak or inappropriate transitions. \n\n2. Then, consider the relationship between the different ideas and points you have presented in your essay. Identify how the ideas connect and try to use transition words or phrases that best fit the relationship between the ideas.\n\n3. You can use several types of transitions such as addition, comparison, contrast, cause and effect, or chronological transitions. \n\n4. For example, use the addition transitional phrases \"furthermore\" or \"in addition\" to highlight an additional point or \"in conclusion\" to connect your final thoughts.\n\n5. Comparison transitions such as \"similarly\" or \"likewise\" can indicate that two ideas are similar or comparable.\n\n6. Contrast transitions such as \"however\" or \"still\" can reveal a difference or contrast between two ideas.\n\n7. Cause and effect transitions such as \"therefore\" or \"thus\" can indicate the resulting effect of a particular cause.\n\n8. Chronological transitions such as \"firstly,\" \"secondly,\" and \"finally\" can indicate the order in which the ideas are presented.\n\nRemember to use transitions appropriately and sparingly. Overusing transitions can make your essay sound monotonous and tedious. \n\nOnce you have identified the areas where you need to revise, start by replacing weak or inappropriate transitions with appropriate and strong transitions, and remove any unnecessary transitions.\n\nDo you have any questions based on these steps?",

You can use transitional phrases such as \"Moreover,\" \"In addition,\" \"Furthermore,\" or \"On the other hand\" to signal a shift in the direction of the argument.\n\n2. Within a paragraph: While it's common to use transitions between paragraphs, transitions can also be used within a paragraph to help link sentences and ideas. You can use transitional words such as \"Similarly,\" \"Likewise,\" or \"Furthermore\" to connect different ideas within the same paragraph.\n\n3. At the beginning of a sentence: Transitions at the beginning of a sentence can help to link sentences and ideas together. You can use phrases such as \"Furthermore,\" \"In addition,\" \"Moreover,\" or \"Similarly\" at the beginning of a sentence to signal a new idea.\n\n4. At the end of a sentence: Transitions at the end of a sentence can also help link sentences and ideas together. You can use phrases such as \"Therefore,\" \"As a result,\" or \"Consequently\" to indicate the consequence of an idea or argument presented in the previous sentence.\n\nRemember, the key to using transitions effectively is to ensure they flow smoothly and logically from one sentence to the next, providing a clear roadmap for your reader to follow along with your argument.",

To make this essay even better, I have some suggestions for improving the organization, transitions, and grammar. Here are the specific revision notes:\n\n1. In the first paragraph, include a topic sentence to introduce the main idea of the essay.\n\n2. Use transition words and phrases to connect ideas between paragraphs and within sentences. For example, you can add transitions such as \"Moreover,\" \"In addition,\" and \"Furthermore\" to make the connections clearer.\n\n3. Check for subject-verb agreement and verb tense consistency throughout the essay.\n\n4. In the first main paragraph, provide more concrete examples or evidence to support your point. You mention the expensive jackets in South Korea, which is good, but you could also include statistics or stories from other places to further strengthen your argument.\n\n5. In the second main paragraph, explain why a unified image and identity are valuable for academic and social success. You suggest that a sense of unity is important, but you could also explain how it benefits students in terms of learning and communication.\n\n6. In the conclusion, restate the thesis statement and summarize the main points without introducing new ideas.\n\nPlease take these revision notes into consideration as you revise your essay. Let me know if you have any questions!",

        "response": "Majority of people has experienced wearing their school uniform. The traditional notion that students should wear school uniforms has persisted for a long time, even today. However, some schools allow students to wear regular clothes when they attend school. While student freedom is important, I believe that high schools should control students' clothing and require them to wear a consistent school uniform. There are two main reasons why I assert this statement.\nFirstly, wearing school uniforms is very economical. It's a well-known fact that young people are usually interested in fashion or trends, so they buy new clothes or accessories that are popular among their friends. For example, in the 2000s, some students in South Korea were known as \"backbone brokers\" and required expensive jackets, such as Goose down, from their parents. If high schools controlled what students wore with a uniform, they would not need to buy expensive and high-quality clothes to wear to school. Moreover, since students wear the same school uniform for five days a week, they don't need a large amount of clothes for everyday life. With this in mind, wearing school uniforms can reduce the cost of clothing and is therefore an economical choice.\nSecondly, school uniforms are able to represent a school's identity. Once a school selects a uniform, it usually remains unchanged for a long time. In other words, many people who graduated from a school wore the same uniform. Therefore, a school uniform becomes a symbol of the school. For instance, if you see some students wearing a particular school uniform on the street, you can recognize the name of the school they are attending. Furthermore, wearing a school uniform may also foster a sense of unity and integration among students, as they all wear the same design. Unity of a school may make students passionate and of course it would help learning or communicating with other students in same school. I believe that school uniforms can create a unified image and identity for each school.\nIn conclusion, wearing school uniforms helps to reduce economic burden and creates a sense of identity at school. Therefore, I believe that school uniforms should be required for high school students. By wearing uniforms, students avoid the need to buy expensive clothing and can represent their school's identity. This fosters a sense of unity, which is valuable for academic and social success.",

Regarding your thesis sentence, it gives a clear opinion that high schools should control students' clothing and require them to wear a consistent school uniform, and it also mentions two reasons for this belief. However, the thesis sentence would be stronger if it explicitly mentioned what those reasons are. Have a look at the thesis statement below as an example: \n\n\"Although some may argue that high school students should be free to wear their own clothes, I strongly believe that schools should require students to wear a uniform for two main reasons: to reduce the economic burden on families and to foster a sense of unity and school identity.\"\n\nTry to revise your thesis sentence by including the reasons you have discussed in your essay to make it more specific.

This will help the reader understand the importance of the issue and why it matters.\n\n3. State your thesis: Clearly state your argument or position on the topic. This will give the reader a roadmap for what to expect in the rest of your essay.\n\nHere's an example of a stronger introduction:\n\n\"Did you know that over 40 million Americans live in poverty? While some argue that the government should only provide assistance to those most in need, I believe that it is the government's responsibility to support all citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic background. In this essay, I will argue that a just and equitable society requires that the government provide support to all citizens, and not just those who are most in need.\"",

Next, be polite to others. If a speaker talks politely, the listener will also try to be so. Polite taking will make friends to be closer because the speaker will think that the listener is focusing to the speaker’s word. Finally, always make smile.

Use \"make\" or \"taking\" before \"first\" to signify you \"take the initiative\" to start a conversation with a friend.\n \nCorrection: \"First, taking the initiative is important. To start a conversation and become closer, it is necessary to talk first to others.\"\n\n2. The sentence \"Make the word before the friend talks\" is unclear. Perhaps you meant to say \"Speak before the friend talks\"?\n\nCorrection: \"Speak first before your friend does. That way, your friend will have less burden to talk first when you meet later.\"\n\n3. The grammar in the sentence \"If a speaker talks politely, the listener will also try to be so\" is incorrect. It should be \"If a speaker speaks politely, the listener will also try to do so.\"\n\nCorrection: \"Next, be polite when speaking to others. If you speak politely, the listener will also try to do so. Polite conversation will make friends feel closer to you because they know you are actively paying attention to their words.\"\n\n4. Use \"always smile\" instead of \"always make smile\", as \"make\" implies creating something, while \"smile\" is a verb that communicates a state of being.\n\nCorrection: \"Finally, always smile. A smile makes you look more friendly and kind. Additionally, others will likely respond positively to your smile, which will create a happier conversation. In summary, it is important to take the initiative, be polite when speaking, and always smile around friends.\"\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.",

This means that you should have a thesis statement or a main idea that is expressed clearly and is relevant to the topic at hand.\n\n2. Structure: Organize the essay in a logical manner, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The introduction should capture the reader's attention and inform them of what the essay will be about. The body should present your arguments or ideas, supported by relevant evidence or examples. The conclusion should summarize your main points and leave a lasting impression on the reader.\n\n3. Clarity: Write clearly and concisely, avoiding ambiguous or overly-complex language. Use specific examples and evidence to support your points, and vary your sentence structure to keep the reader engaged.\n\n4. Grammar and punctuation: Always check your grammar and punctuation carefully, and ensure that your essay is free of spelling or typographical errors. Use proper capitalization and punctuation, and make sure that your writing is easy to read.\n\n5. Editing and proofreading: Always take the time to edit and proofread your essay carefully before submitting it. This means checking for errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling, as well as reviewing the clarity and logic of your arguments. \n\nDoes this help?",

University these days has become extremely expensive and not all families can provide funds for their children to continue with their studies. We can extimate an average of 500$ spent in a semester only in books and class utilities. This represents a big portion of a wage for people with financial difficulties. That is why governament should help them achieve a better education with scholarships and funds. People with high socioeconomic background have more opportunities to continue with their education, even if the annual payment for a school is high. If people in need recive the proper help, they can have multiple job options with high wage, which will favor not only his current family but also its future children.\n",

Structure: The paragraph could be divided into two or three smaller paragraphs to make it easier to read and follow. A clear introduction and conclusion would also help to frame the discussion.\n\n3. Clarity: Some of the language in the paragraph is a bit confusing or unclear, such as the phrase \"We can extimate an average of 500$ spent in a semester only in books and class utilities.\" It would be better to rephrase this for clarity and simplicity.\n\n4. Grammar and punctuation: The paragraph has some errors in grammar, such as \"governament\" instead of \"government,\" and some of the sentences could be rephrased for better syntax.\n\n5. Editing and proofreading: The paragraph could benefit from a careful review for errors and clarity, as well as a focus on using specific evidence and examples to support the argument.\n\nBased on these points, I would rate this paragraph as needing some revision to improve its clarity and organization.",

Both citizens and political parties have varying opinions, making it hard for a democratic consensus to be reached. I believe government should help individuals following their income, giving priority to those in the most need. This approach will help them to explore new opportunities and lower the poverty rate of the country.\n\nMany people from lower socio-economic classes tend to have less education due to the high cost of universities. These days, tuition fees and the cost of textbooks and class supplies can easily average at $500 per semester, which represents a significant portion of income for people with financial difficulties. Therefore, the government should provide scholarships and financial aid to help them achieve a better education. People from wealthier backgrounds have more opportunities to pursue higher education, even if it comes at a high annual cost. If individuals in need receive the proper assistance, they can have access to job opportunities with higher wages, which would benefit not only their current families but also future generations.\n\nMoreover, governments are trying to fight against the high rate of poverty in their country. To achieve this, those in need need to be helped by the government, not only with funds but also with new jobs, better housing, and incentives. This will benefit the image of the country along with helping the lower classes. Some countries, such as South Korea, are facing rapid growth, which leads to an increase in the gap between poor people and rich families. In cities like Seoul, we tend to see extremely fancy districts and right around the corner old houses which look almost like they are falling apart. Most of them are filled with the old generation, which was left behind during the economic expansion. The situation may not be attractive to tourists, who might feel uncomfortable with sleeping in such areas. The government has to preserve the image of the country while helping those in need.\n\nIn conclusion, by investing in those most in need, governments not only improve the lives of individuals and communities, but also pave the way for a brighter and more prosperous future.

Lastly, you mention the income gap in South Korea, but you don't dive into it as much as you could. You could incorporate more information to describe how this income gap affects people's lives.\n\nFinally, your conclusion is well-written, but it could be stronger.

These days, tuition fees and the cost of textbooks and class supplies can easily average at $500 per semester, which represents a significant portion of income for people with financial difficulties. Therefore, the government should provide scholarships and financial aid to help them achieve a better education. People from wealthier backgrounds have more opportunities to pursue higher education, even if it comes at a high annual cost. If individuals in need receive the proper assistance, they can have access to job opportunities with higher wages, which would benefit not only their current families but also future generations.\n\nMoreover, governments are trying to fight against the high rate of poverty in their country. To achieve this, those in need need to be helped by the government, not only with funds but also with new jobs, better housing, and incentives. This will benefit the image of the country along with helping the lower classes. Some countries, such as South Korea, are facing rapid growth, which leads to an increase in the gap between poor people and rich families: the income gap between the wealthiest 10% and least wealthy 10% in South Korea is substantial, with a difference of 21 times(Hankyoreh, 2021). In cities like Seoul, we tend to see extremely fancy districts and right around the corner old houses which look almost like they are falling apart. Most of them are filled with the old generation, which was left behind during the economic expansion. The situation may not be attractive to tourists, who might feel uncomfortable with sleeping in such areas. The government has to preserve the image of the country while helping those in need.\n\nIn conclusion, by investing in those most in need, governments not only improve the lives of individuals and communities, but also pave the way for a brighter and more prosperous future. After all, a government that helps the less fortunate is a government that understands the true meaning of 'two-for-one' specials!\n\n\nHOW MANY WORDS HAS THIS ESSAY?\n",

Here is an example of a sentence with a noun clause: \n\n\"That she performed well in the exam was surprising to everyone.\"\n\nIn this sentence, \"that she performed well in the exam\" is the noun clause, and it is the subject of the sentence. \n\nYou can use noun clauses in many different situations where you would need a noun in a sentence. Examples include subject position, object position, and after certain prepositions. \n\nNow, please share your essay with me, and we will work together to revise it by incorporating noun clauses if possible.",

I believe government should help individuals following their income, giving priority to those in the most need. This approach will help them to explore new opportunities and lower the poverty rate of the country.\n\nMany people from lower socio-economic classes tend to have less education due to the high cost of universities. These days, tuition fees and the cost of textbooks and class supplies can easily average at $500 per semester, which represents a significant portion of income for people with financial difficulties. Therefore, the government should provide scholarships and financial aid to help them achieve a better education. People from wealthier backgrounds have more opportunities to pursue higher education, even if it comes at a high annual cost. If individuals in need receive the proper assistance, they can have access to job opportunities with higher wages, which would benefit not only their current families but also future generations.\n\nMoreover, governments are trying to fight against the high rate of poverty in their country. To achieve this, those in need need to be helped by the government, not only with funds but also with new jobs, better housing, and incentives. This will benefit the image of the country along with helping the lower classes. Some countries, such as South Korea, are facing rapid growth, which leads to an increase in the gap between poor people and rich families: the income gap between the wealthiest 10% and least wealthy 10% in South Korea is substantial, with a difference of 21 times(Hankyoreh, 2021).In cities like Seoul, extremely fancy districts are seen and right around the corner, old houses which look almost like they are falling apart are present. Most of them are filled with the old generation, which was left behind during the economic expansion. The situation may not be attractive to tourists, who might feel uncomfortable with sleeping in such areas. The government has to preserve the image of the country while helping those in need.\n\nIn conclusion, by investing in those most in need, governments not only improve the lives of individuals and communities, but also pave the way for a brighter and more prosperous future. Therefore, a government that assists the underprivileged can aid in fostering a fair and inclusive society, driving towards a more prosperous future.\n\n\nis there any noun clause here?",

When other usual universities select a major before they come to university and keep on trach of it, we choose major in second year. This policy makes a lot of benefits to students and university.\n First, students can have a extra time to think about their dream. Since the university make a score of students high school work, it's so important for students that they are afraid of changing their major area in the second or third year of high school. Instead, they choose the major in first grade of school and continuously work on it for three years, only for the college. How could a person make a decision of what to do in whole life, only in a age of 17? In the effect of policy about education in Korea, students don't have enough time to experience largely, and widely. So 'the first year of college be major free' can help students to have a time wondering what they will be in future, and experience lots of things as a adult. It could seen as wasting time (for 1 years) to study on their dream and major, but it could also seen as saving the time, because changing a major at the end of college Iwould take a time more than a year.\n Second, students can take a break after a hard time studying in high school for three years. Even though some students totally made a decision about major before college, it would be not a bad sounds to hear. Many people dream about campous life. Everyone knew that university is a place where we study about deeper knowledge of many things, but having a good time with college friends from the world (or just ofther city) can helpful to students. Not only taking a break, but also meeting much more people than school can improve their wideth and depth of thoughts and creativity.\n Third, as the time goes, many major areas share a same topic, like AI or argorithum. And if we plus the classes we have to listen like physics or math, their would be no time waste which some people are worried about. This could be the change of the study through years. A lot of time before, there was little subjects to share between different majors. And now, it's the time we have to change.\n And last but not least, colleges can also less worry about enrolling student amount of each major. Some majors are more popular then others. Then do we have to change the people amout to enroll, Like hundred in chemistry and fifty in physics? By using this policy, colleges don't need to think about that kind of enrollment, Students will change their major as they want. College would just have to see is they would study hard in college.\n\nCan you check a grammer error about comma rules, adjectives, and adverbs?",

        "response": "Sure, let's take a look at the grammar in your essay. \n\n- In the second sentence, you have a list of actions and should use commas to separate them. It should read: \"When other usual universities select a major before they come to university, and keep on track of it, we choose a major in the second year.\"\n\n- In the fourth sentence, \"score\" should be \"scores,\" since the university is taking into account all of a student's high school work. It should read: \"Since the university makes scores of students' high school work, it's so important for students that they are afraid of changing their major area in the second or third year of high school.\"\n\n- In the fifth sentence, \"guess\" should be \"decision\" to more accurately convey the idea. It should read: \"How could a person make a decision of what to do in their whole life, only at the age of 17?\"\n\n- In the sixth sentence, \"largely\" should be \"broadly,\" which better fits the context. It should read: \"So 'the first year of college being major-free' can help students to have a time wondering what they will be in the future and experience many things as adults.\"\n\n- In the ninth sentence, \"campous\" should be \"campus.\" It should read: \"Many people dream about campus life.\"\n\n- In the eleventh sentence, \"algorithm\" is misspelled as \"argorithum.\" It should read: \"...many major areas share the same topics, like AI or algorithm.\"\n\nRegarding the use of adjectives and adverbs, you might consider adding more detail to your writing. For example, you could describe a \"hard time\" studying in high school as being \"stressful\" or \"hectic.\" You could also consider using adverbs to explain how certain verbs are performed. For instance, you could use an adverb to describe how students \"work\" for three years, such as \"diligently\" or \"steadfastly.\" \n\nOverall, your essay presents some good ideas, and with a few minor revisions could be even stronger.

When other usual universities select a major before they come to university, and keep on trach of it, we choose major in second year. This policy makes a lot of benefits to students and university.\n First, students can have a extra time to think about their dream. Since the university make scores of students' high school work, it's so important for students that they are afraid of changing their major area in the second or third year of high school. Instead, they choose the major in first grade of school and continuously diligently work on it for three years, only for the college. How could a person make a decision of what to do in their whole life, only in the age of 17? In the effect of policy about education in Korea, students don't have enough time to experience largely, and widely. So 'the first year of college being major-free' can help students to have a time wondering what they will be in the future and experience many things as adults. It could seen as wasting time (for 1 years) to study on their dream and major, but it could also seen as saving the time, because changing a major at the end of college Iwould take a time more than a year.\n Second, students can take a break after a stressful time studying in high school for three years. Even though some students totally made a decision about major before college, it would be not a bad sounds to hear. Many people dream about campus life. Everyone knew that university is a place where we study about deeper knowledge of many things, but having a good time with college friends from the world (or just ofther city) can helpful to students. Not only taking a break, but also meeting much more people than school can improve their wideth and depth of thoughts and creativity.\n Third, as the time goes, many major areas share a same topic, like AI or argorithm. And if we plus the classes we have to listen like physics or math, their would be no time waste which some people are worried about. This could be the change of the study through years. A lot of time before, there was little subjects to share between different majors. And now, it's the time we have to change.\n And last but not least, colleges can also less worry about enrolling student amount of each major. Some majors are more popular then others. Then do we have to change the people amout to enroll, Like hundred in chemistry and fifty in physics? By using this policy, colleges don't need to think about that kind of enrollment, Students will change their major as they want. College would just have to see is they would study hard in college.",

Choosing a major at the early age of 17 is difficult, and it is important to provide students with enough time to explore their options.

Although this may seem like a waste of time, it is better to spend one extra year exploring than regretting a wrong choice. \n\nSecondly, students can benefit from a break after a demanding high school experience that had lasted for three years. Even if students have already decided on their major, taking time to meet people from all over the world and spend time with new friends can be beneficial.

Instead, they can focus solely on ensuring that enrolled students are studying and meeting their academic obligations. \n\nTo revise your essay, we can focus on improving the paragraph structure. Firstly, we need to break down the text into paragraphs based on the main points you are trying to make. I suggest three paragraphs: one for discussing the benefits of the policy, another for discussing the effect on students, and the last one discussing the effect on the university.

Incorporate complex sentences to show relationships between ideas.\n\nYou have included several examples of cause and effect relationships, which can be expressed more effectively using dependent clauses. Here's an example:\n\nBefore: \"Choosing a major at the early age of 17 is difficult, and it is important to provide students with enough time to explore their options.\"\n\nAfter: \"Since choosing a major at the early age of 17 is difficult, it is important to provide students with enough time to explore their options.\"\n\nBy starting the sentence with a subordinating conjunction, you can clearly show the cause and effect relationship between the two ideas.\n\n2. Vary your sentence structure.\n\nTo keep your essay engaging and avoid repetition, you can vary your sentence structures. Here's an example:\n\nBefore: \"Even if students have already decided on their major, taking time to meet people from all over the world and spend time with new friends can be beneficial.\"\n\nAfter: \"Despite having already decided on their major, students can benefit from taking time to meet people from all over the world and spend time with new friends.\"\n\nIn this revised sentence, we've used the dependent clause \"despite having already decided on their major\" to show a contrasting idea, which adds variation to your essay.\n\n3. Use transitions to show connections between paragraphs.\n\nTransitions help guide the reader through your essay and show the connections between ideas. Here's an example:\n\nBefore:\n\nFurthermore, over time, many subjects within different majors have started overlapping, especially with the rise of artificial intelligence. Giving students the opportunity to explore various subjects can improve their understanding of the shared topics, which improves their perspective on their major.\n\nAfter:\n\nFurthermore, over time, many subjects within different majors have started overlapping, especially with the rise of artificial intelligence.

All sentences and details focus on supporting that one main idea. Everything should be connected, and it is unity. Unity helps the reader follow the writer's ideas. The reader expects each paragraph to have one main idea. When both the writer and reader follow this agreement, both writing and reading become a lot easier. And coherence is how well ideas are connected within a paragraph. Coherence is a logical bridge between words and sentences in essays. Sentences need to be ordered in a logical way with clear transitions.",

        "response": "Great! Now that you have a good understanding of unity and coherence, let's take a look at your essay and see how we can improve it.\n\nFirst, let's focus on unity. Can you identify the main idea of each paragraph in your essay? If not, go through each paragraph and write down the main idea in one sentence. \n\nOnce you have identified the main idea of each paragraph, make sure that all the sentences in that paragraph support that main idea. If there are any sentences that do not support the main idea, consider removing them or rephrasing them to better fit the paragraph's focus.\n\nNext, let's work on coherence. Look at the order of your sentences within each paragraph. Are they in a logical order? Do they flow smoothly from one sentence to the next? If not, consider rearranging the sentences or adding transition words to help connect them.\n\nFinally, make sure that there are clear transitions between each paragraph. This will help the reader follow your ideas and understand how they are connected. Consider using transition words or phrases such as \"in addition,\" \"however,\" or \"therefore\" to help connect your paragraphs.\n\nRemember, the goal is to have each paragraph focus on one main idea and to have all the sentences within that paragraph support that main idea. Additionally, the sentences should be ordered in a logical way with clear transitions between paragraphs. Keep these principles in mind as you revise your essay.",

Unlike other universities, where students select their majors before starting college and continue to study it, we choose a major in the second year. This policy has several benefits for both students and university. The reason for this is because of various causes and effects.\nFirstly, being major-free in the first year allows students to have extra time to make decisions about their future. High school grades are very important when it comes to selecting majors, which puts a lot of pressure on students. Often, students choose their major solely based on their high school performance, which might not be a reliable indicator of interests or strengths. Since choosing a major at the early age of 17 is difficult, it is important to provide students with enough time to explore their options. Therefore, being major-free in the first year can provide students with time to experience different things as adults and have time to think about their dreams. This can help prevent students from feeling rushed to make such important decisions.\nSecondly, students can benefit from a break after a demanding high school experience that had lasted for three years. Despite having already decided on their major, students can benefit from taking time to meet people from all over the world and spend time with new friends. This time can help students to learn new perspectives, increase creativity, and improve their worldview. So, students can benefit by taking a break and having the freedom to explore college life without the constraints of a specific major.\nFurthermore, over time, many subjects within different majors have started overlapping, especially with the rise of artificial intelligence. As a result, giving students the opportunity to explore various subjects can improve their understanding of the shared topics and, in turn, improve their perspective on their major. Since many majors share similar course requirements like mathematics and physics, there would be no concern about wasting time on unrelated courses. Thus, students can benefit from a well-rounded education.\nLastly, colleges can worry less about enrolling students for different majors, as not all majors are equally popular. By allowing students to change their major as they wish, colleges do not have to worry about involuntary enrolment in less popular majors or over-enrolling in popular ones. Instead, they can focus solely on ensuring that enrolled students are studying and meeting their academic obligations. As a result, the university can benefit from a more flexible system that can adapt to the needs of students without the burden of bureaucratic obstacles.\nOverall, being major-free in the first year of university can provide many benefits for both students and universities. Through the use of cause and effect paragraphs, we can better understand how this policy can benefit society as a whole.\"",

To make your essay cohesive, use transition words such as \"firstly,\" \"secondly,\" and \"thirdly\" to signal the start of a new point.\n\n2. Provide more detail - You provide good examples of how students can use a tablet for online research and personalized learning, but you could have provided some specific applications or websites that students can use. This way, the reader can have a more concrete idea of what programs or websites are available.\n\n3. Edit for word repetition - There are some phrases that are repeated throughout your essay, such as \"using tablets\" and \"in class.\" Try to vary your language and use synonyms or different phrasing to keep your essay fresh.\n\n4. Consider the tone - Lastly, consider the tone of your essay. While your essay is informative, it may come across as too matter-of-fact, and lacks a personal touch. You can add more voice by sharing some anecdotes or reflecting on your personal experience of using a tablet in class.\n\nOverall, your essay has a good structure and provides some strong arguments for the advantages of using tablets in class.

My opinion is in my essay, and below is my essay.\n\nAdvantages of Using Tablets in Class Using tablets in class has become increasingly popular among students due to their numerous advantages. Firstly, using tablets can decrease the weight of your bag. If you don't use a tablet, you would have to bring many textbooks and notes in your bag, which can be quite heavy and make you tired. However, if you use a tablet, you can save all textbook files on the tablet and take notes by using it, allowing you to travel lighter. Secondly, students can use the internet comfortably on a tablet. If you encounter something you don't understand in class, a tablet's internet capabilities allow you to figure it out immediately. Additionally, tablets provide access to online resources like digital versions of academic journals, research papers, and videos, which provide a wider range of resources to draw from, enhancing your understanding of the subject matter. Thirdly, using a tablet can help students study more efficiently. With interactive textbooks and educational apps, tablets provide a more immersive and interactive way of learning. Tablets also offer personalized learning opportunities by adapting their lessons and activities to the individual student's learning style and ability level. This enables students to focus on their specific areas of weakness and improve their comprehension and retention of material. In summary, these are several reasons why using tablets in class can benefit students. By having access to a wealth of learning resources, the ability to engage with interactive learning tools, and the opportunity to receive personalized instruction, students can achieve better outcomes in their academic pursuits.",

Check for parallelism: This is when you use similar grammatical structures, phrases, or words to create balance in your writing. Look for places in your essay where you can use parallel structure to improve the flow and emphasis of your writing.\n\n2. Identify and correct sentence problems: There are a lot of potential sentence problems that you might encounter in writing, including run-on sentences, sentence fragments, and misplaced modifiers, among others. Make sure that you read through your essay carefully to identify any issues that might be holding back your writing.\n\nWith those points in mind, let's start with your essay.

        "response": "I think that the government should help those most in need because of three reasons. First, the government can do things that individuals can’t. Second, it is hard for those in need to live well by their own. And last, the help of the government will make the whole society happy.\n\tWhy do you think the government takes places at the first place? It is to do things that individuals can’t by themselves. It is hard for normal people to find those who need help, and give help to them. Helping those in need is one of the best thing that the government can do.\n\tSecond, money comes from money. Unlike helping all of the citizens, helping particular people makes the society much more different. If the government helps all the people, the gap between the rich and the poor will not be reduced, but be intensified. There fore, the rich will be easy to maintain life, and the poor should scrub along. However, if the government help those in need, they will have a base to develop, and that’s not making the society become fixed, but making it much more different and flexible in a good way.\n\tLastly, the particular help of the government will make the whole society happy. Have you seen articles that cover that most of the capital is owned by very tiny percent of the society? As it says, too much capital is unnecessarily taken by few people. For the good of much more people, the government should at least help people that are exactly the opposite side of the very tiny percent of the society that takes most of the capital. \n\tBecause of these three reasons, for the good for all people, I strongly believe that the government should help those most in need.",

        "response": "Great! Let's start with revising the essay focusing on parallel structure. As a teacher, I suggest you identify places in the essay where you could enhance parallel structure. Here are some examples:\n\n1. In the first paragraph, you could revise \"the government can do things that individuals can’t\" and \"it is hard for those in need to live well by their own.\" for parallel structure. You could rewrite it as \"the government can do things that individuals can’t, and it is hard for those in need to live well on their own.\"\n\n2. In the second paragraph, you could revise \"money comes from money\" for a parallel structure. You could rewrite it as \"money makes money.\"\n\n3. In the third paragraph, you could revise \"making the society much more different\" for parallel structure. You could rewrite it as \"making the society much more diverse.\"\n\n4. In the last paragraph, you could revise \"the particular help of the government will make the whole society happy\" for parallel structure. You could rewrite it as \"the particular help of the government will make the whole society happier.\"\n\nRemember to use similar grammatical structures and phrases to create balance in your writing. Now, let's move on to the sentence problems.\n\nRead through your essay carefully and identify any sentence problems. Here are a few common sentence problems to consider:\n\n1. Run-on sentences: When two or more sentences are joined together without proper punctuation, it creates a run-on sentence. To fix this, you could either separate the sentences or use proper punctuation, such as a comma or semicolon.\n\n2. Sentence Fragments: A sentence fragment is an incomplete sentence that is missing a subject or verb. To fix this, you could add a subject or verb to complete the sentence.\n\n3. Misplaced Modifiers: A misplaced modifier can create confusion or change the meaning of a sentence. To fix this, you could place the modifier next to the word it modifies or revise the sentence structure to avoid the problem.\n\nKeep these sentence problems in mind as you review your essay for clarity and coherence.\n\nNow, I encourage you to revise your essay, focusing on parallel structure. Once you have completed that step, please review the essay again and identify any sentence problems. Let me know if you need any assistance with the revision process.",

Here are some examples:\n\n1. In the first paragraph, you could revise \"the government can do things that individuals can’t\" and \"it is hard for those in need to live well by their own.\" for parallel structure. You could rewrite it as \"the government can do things that individuals can’t, and it is hard for those in need to live well on their own.\"\n\n2. In the second paragraph, you could revise \"money comes from money\" for a parallel structure. You could rewrite it as \"money makes money.\"\n\n3. In the third paragraph, you could revise \"making the society much more different\" for parallel structure. You could rewrite it as \"making the society much more diverse.\"\n\n4. In the last paragraph, you could revise \"the particular help of the government will make the whole society happy\" for parallel structure. You could rewrite it as \"the particular help of the government will make the whole society happier.\"\n\nRemember to use similar grammatical structures and phrases to create balance in your writing. Now, let's move on to the sentence problems.\n\nRead through your essay carefully and identify any sentence problems. Here are a few common sentence problems to consider:\n\n1. Run-on sentences: When two or more sentences are joined together without proper punctuation, it creates a run-on sentence. To fix this, you could either separate the sentences or use proper punctuation, such as a comma or semicolon.\n\n2. Sentence Fragments: A sentence fragment is an incomplete sentence that is missing a subject or verb. To fix this, you could add a subject or verb to complete the sentence.\n\n3. Misplaced Modifiers: A misplaced modifier can create confusion or change the meaning of a sentence. To fix this, you could place the modifier next to the word it modifies or revise the sentence structure to avoid the problem.\n\nKeep these sentence problems in mind as you review your essay for clarity and coherence.\n\nNow, I encourage you to revise your essay, focusing on parallel structure. Once you have completed that step, please review the essay again and identify any sentence problems. Let me know if you need any assistance with the revision process.",

Begin by introducing the topic or problem that you will be discussing in the essay.\n\n2. Provide some general background information about the topic or problem, but write it in a way that doesn't reveal your personal viewpoint or opinion. You can include research and statistics from reputable sources to provide credibility to your writing.\n\n3. Use third person pronouns throughout the essay. For example, instead of writing, \"I believe that...\", write \"It is believed that...\", or \"Research shows that...\".\n\n4. Clearly state the cause-and-effect relationship that you will be exploring in your essay. For example, \"The main cause of the environmental problem is pollution, which leads to various negative effects.\"\n\n5. Examine the causes and effects of the problem in separate paragraphs. Provide evidence from credible sources, including facts and statistics, to support your claims. Use transition words to smoothly connect your paragraphs and show how each cause leads to specific consequences.\n\n6. Conclude your essay by summarizing the causes and effects of the problem you have identified. Don't include any personal opinions but end the essay with a call to action, i.e., what needs to be done to address the issue or problem that you have discussed.\n\nRemember, writing in the third person point of view throughout the essay is essential. Instead of referring to yourself, such as \"I think that...\", always use the appropriate third person pronouns like \"he,\" \"she,\" or \"they.\"",

The consequent rise in global temperatures has resulted in a range of negative effects, including extreme weather events, sea level rise, and loss of biodiversity. These effects cause both direct and indirect harm to communities worldwide through floods, droughts, and extreme heatwaves. Furthermore, the impact on plants and animals can be fatal since rising temperatures disrupt ecosystems and threaten entire species with extinction.

        "response": "Fast food is a type of food that is known for its quick preparation time and easy accessibility, while having lots of problems. The popularity of fast food has grown significantly since the 1950s when it was first introduced. Fast foods can be found in chain restaurants that sell only fast foods for sales. For well known chain restaurants, there are  McDonald’s, Lotteria, Burger King, and KFC.  Because these chain restaurants are in almost every place, the accessibility of fast foods are very good. However, while fast food is a convenient and affordable option for many people, it has been associated with several health problems that have many people in the society has, or has a risk of  getting those problems. In this essay, the reason why people prefer fast foods, and the effects of fast foods will be dealt with. \n\nOne of the primary reasons for the popularity of fast food is its convenience. There are big 3 reasons why fast foods are convenient. First, fast food restaurants are typically located in busy areas or all over the world. So when people travel around the world and doesn’t have anything to eat, fast foods are one of the best choice. \n\n        Second, they are open for extended hours, when other restaurants are on a break time or are closed. For students or office workers that work last and are hungry, the only choice to fill one’s hunger. \n\nLastly, when there is less time or inappropriate place to eat, fast food has a benefit. For people with busy schedules or who has a next schedule, like the word “fast food”, the cooking process and distribution process are so fast, so that it's good to fill up the energy quickly. Additionally, fast food is easy to eat while driving or walking, further contributing to its convenience factor.\n\nThe low cost of fast food is one of the primary reasons why it has become so popular among people of all ages and backgrounds. Why are fast foods cheap? There are several reasons. Fast food restaurants tend to have simple menus with limited options, which helps to reduce costs by minimizing the number of ingredients needed and simplifying the cooking process. They also tend to rely on pre-packaged and pre-portioned ingredients, which reduces waste and helps to keep costs down.\n\nAlso, fast food restaurants typically have lower overhead costs than sit-down restaurants. They often operate in high-traffic areas with lower rent costs, and they require less space for seating and dining areas. This allows them to focus on the food preparation and service, rather than on creating an elaborate dining experience.\nFor these these reasons, fast food restaurants offer a quick, convenient, and affordable option for people who are looking for a quick bite to eat without breaking the bank. While fast food has been associated with a range of health problems, there are also some benefits to its low cost.\nOne of the most significant benefits of the low cost of fast food is its affordability for people on a tight budget. For many people, fast food is the only viable option when it comes to eating out. Eating at a sit-down restaurant or purchasing groceries and preparing meals at home can be expensive, and not everyone has the resources or time to do so. In these cases, fast food can be a lifesaver, providing an affordable and convenient option for people who are on a tight budget.\n\nHowever, while fast food is convenient and affordable, it has been linked to several health problems. One of the most significant health issues associated with fast food is obesity. Fast food is often high in calories, fat, and sugar, which can contribute to weight gain. Studies have shown that people who eat fast food regularly are more likely to be overweight or obese than those who do not. Moreover, fast food is often high in salt, which can lead to high blood pressure and other health problems.\n\nAnother health problem associated with fast food is diabetes. Fast food is often high in carbohydrates, which can cause blood sugar levels to spike. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. A diet high in fast food can also increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nFast food is also linked to heart disease. Fast food is often high in saturated and trans fats, which can increase cholesterol levels and lead to the buildup of plaque in the arteries. This can result in heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes. In addition, fast food consumption has been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate cancer.\n\nMoreover, fast food has been linked to mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. This is thought to be due to the high levels of sugar and fat in fast food, which can affect mood and contribute to mental health problems. Fast food consumption has also been associated with poor academic performance in children and teenagers, potentially due to the negative effects of a poor diet on cognitive function.\n\nDespite the negative effects of fast food, it remains a popular choice for many people. This may be due in part to the addictive qualities of fast food, which can make it difficult for people to resist. Additionally, fast food is often marketed to children and teenagers through targeted advertising and promotions, which can make it an appealing choice for young people.\n\nAside from health problems, fast food has other negative effects as well. For instance, it can harm the environment due to the generation of large amounts of waste, including packaging, food waste, and plastic utensils. This waste contributes to pollution and can have adverse impacts on wildlife. Additionally, fast food chains can negatively impact local economies, as they can drive smaller, locally-owned restaurants out of business, leading to job losses and a decrease in economic activity in the local community.\n\n\tFast food, with its easy accessibility and affordability in both urban and rural areas, provides a quick source of energy. However, despite the convenience it offers, frequent consumption of fast food can lead to various negative impacts, most notably health issues. The high salt and fat content of fast food can contribute to a range of health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and even mental health conditions such as depression.\n",

Reasons for the Popularity of Fast Food\nFast food has become increasingly popular among consumers due to its convenience, extended hours of operation, and ease of consumption while on-the-go.\n\na. Convenience\nFast food restaurants are frequently located in high-traffic areas, making them accessible to people who are traveling or on-the-go. Their widespread availability means that they are often the easiest option for busy individuals who need to grab a quick meal.\n\nb. Extended hours\nFast food restaurants are often open late into the night, making them a convenient option for those who need a late-night snack or meal. This extended access makes fast food a reliable and consistent source of food for people with busy schedules.\n\nc. Easy to eat on-the-go\nFast food is designed to be easily consumed, even while on-the-go. The packaging and portion sizes are designed to be portable, so people can eat while driving or walking.\n\nII. Low Cost of Fast Food\nFast food is also popular because it is relatively cheap compared to other types of food. The low cost is due to the simple menus, pre-packaging, and lower overhead costs.\n\na. Simple Menus and Pre-Packaging\nFast food restaurants have simple menus with limited options, which reduces the number of ingredients needed and simplifies the cooking process. They also rely on pre-packaged and pre-portioned ingredients, reducing waste and keeping costs down.\n\nb. Lower Overhead Costs\nFast food chains often operate in high-traffic areas where rent is less expensive, and they require less physical space for seating and dining areas. This enables them to focus on food preparation and service rather than creating an elaborate dining experience.\n\nIII. Negative Health Effects of Fast Food \nDespite the popularity of fast food, there are negative health effects associated with its consumption.\n\na. Obesity\nFast food is often high in calories, fat, and sugar, which can contribute to weight gain. Studies have shown that people who eat fast food regularly are more likely to be overweight or obese than those who do not.\n\nb. Diabetes\nFast food is also often high in carbohydrates, which can cause blood sugar levels to spike. This can lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. A diet high in fast food has also been linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nc. Heart Disease \nFast food is often high in saturated and trans fats, which can increase cholesterol levels and lead to the buildup of plaque in arteries.

The high levels of sugar and fat in fast food can affect mood and contribute to mental health problems. Fast food consumption has also been linked to poor academic performance in children and teenagers, potentially due to the negative effects of a poor diet on cognitive function.\n\nIV. Other Negative Effects of Fast Food \n Fast food can have several other negative effects, including its impact on the environment and local economies.\n\na. Environmental Impact \nFast food chains generate significant amounts of waste, including packaging, food waste, and plastic utensils, which contributes to pollution and can have adverse impacts on wildlife.\n\nb. Negative Effect on Local Economies \nFast food chains can negatively impact local economies, as they can drive smaller, locally-owned restaurants out of business, leading to job losses and a decrease in economic activity in the community.\n\nBy breaking up the body paragraphs into subheadings, it is easier for the reader to follow and understand the different topics and categories that you are discussing.

Additionally, fast food has negative effects in terms of the environment and local economies. Although fast food remains a popular choice for many people, it is essential to understand its detrimental effects and make healthier, more sustainable choices.\n\nTo mitigate the negative impacts of fast food, we can take several simple steps, such as limiting our consumption of fast food, opting for healthier fast food options, and supporting local businesses that offer healthier food choices. We can also voice our concerns to fast food companies about their environmental impact and encourage them to take steps towards sustainability.\n\nIn summary, the convenience and affordability of fast food come at a high cost to our health, the environment, and local economies. By taking proactive steps towards healthier and sustainable choices, we can contribute to a better future for ourselves and our planet.",

In addition, fast food chains can negatively impact local economies, leading to job losses and a decrease in economic activity in the local community.\n\nIn conclusion, fast food, with its easy accessibility and affordability in both urban and rural areas, provides a quick source of energy.

        "response": "\nFast food is a type of food that is known for its quick preparation time and easy accessibility, while having lots of problems. The popularity of fast food has grown significantly since the 1950s when it was first introduced. Fast foods can be found in chain restaurants that sell only fast foods for sales. For well known chain restaurants, there are  McDonald’s, Lotteria, Burger King, and KFC.  Because these chain restaurants are in almost every place, the accessibility of fast foods are very good. However, while fast food is a convenient and affordable option for many people, it has been associated with several health problems that have many people in the society has, or has a risk of  getting those problems. In this essay, the reason why people prefer fast foods, and the effects of fast foods will be dealt with. \n\nOne of the primary reasons for the popularity of fast food is its convenience. There are big 3 reasons why fast foods are convenient. First, fast food restaurants are typically located in busy areas or all over the world. So when people travel around the world and doesn’t have anything to eat, fast foods are one of the best choice. \n\n        Second, they are open for extended hours, when other restaurants are on a break time or are closed. For students or office workers that work last and are hungry, the only choice to fill one’s hunger. \n\nLastly, when there is less time or inappropriate place to eat, fast food has a benefit. For people with busy schedules or who has a next schedule, like the word “fast food”, the cooking process and distribution process are so fast, so that it's good to fill up the energy quickly. Additionally, fast food is easy to eat while driving or walking, further contributing to its convenience factor.\n\nThe low cost of fast food is one of the primary reasons why it has become so popular among people of all ages and backgrounds. Why are fast foods cheap? There are several reasons. Fast food restaurants tend to have simple menus with limited options, which helps to reduce costs by minimizing the number of ingredients needed and simplifying the cooking process. They also tend to rely on pre-packaged and pre-portioned ingredients, which reduces waste and helps to keep costs down.\n\nAlso, fast food restaurants typically have lower overhead costs than sit-down restaurants. They often operate in high-traffic areas with lower rent costs, and they require less space for seating and dining areas. This allows them to focus on the food preparation and service, rather than on creating an elaborate dining experience.\nFor these these reasons, fast food restaurants offer a quick, convenient, and affordable option for people who are looking for a quick bite to eat without breaking the bank. While fast food has been associated with a range of health problems, there are also some benefits to its low cost.\nOne of the most significant benefits of the low cost of fast food is its affordability for people on a tight budget. For many people, fast food is the only viable option when it comes to eating out. Eating at a sit-down restaurant or purchasing groceries and preparing meals at home can be expensive, and not everyone has the resources or time to do so. In these cases, fast food can be a lifesaver, providing an affordable and convenient option for people who are on a tight budget.\n\nHowever, while fast food is convenient and affordable, it has been linked to several health problems. One of the most significant health issues associated with fast food is obesity. Fast food is often high in calories, fat, and sugar, which can contribute to weight gain. Studies have shown that people who eat fast food regularly are more likely to be overweight or obese than those who do not. Moreover, fast food is often high in salt, which can lead to high blood pressure and other health problems.\n\nAnother health problem associated with fast food is diabetes. Fast food is often high in carbohydrates, which can cause blood sugar levels to spike. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. A diet high in fast food can also increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nFast food is also linked to heart disease. Fast food is often high in saturated and trans fats, which can increase cholesterol levels and lead to the buildup of plaque in the arteries. This can result in heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes. In addition, fast food consumption has been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate cancer.\n\nMoreover, fast food has been linked to mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. This is thought to be due to the high levels of sugar and fat in fast food, which can affect mood and contribute to mental health problems. Fast food consumption has also been associated with poor academic performance in children and teenagers, potentially due to the negative effects of a poor diet on cognitive function.\n\nDespite the negative effects of fast food, it remains a popular choice for many people. This may be due in part to the addictive qualities of fast food, which can make it difficult for people to resist. Additionally, fast food is often marketed to children and teenagers through targeted advertising and promotions, which can make it an appealing choice for young people.\n\nAside from health problems, fast food has other negative effects as well. For instance, it can harm the environment due to the generation of large amounts of waste, including packaging, food waste, and plastic utensils. This waste contributes to pollution and can have adverse impacts on wildlife. Additionally, fast food chains can negatively impact local economies, as they can drive smaller, locally-owned restaurants out of business, leading to job losses and a decrease in economic activity in the local community.\n\n\tFast food, with its easy accessibility and affordability in both urban and rural areas, provides a quick source of energy. However, despite the convenience it offers, frequent consumption of fast food can lead to various negative impacts, most notably health issues. The high salt and fat content of fast food can contribute to a range of health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and even mental health conditions such as depression.\n",

While they both tell stories, they do so in different ways. In this essay, I will compare and contrast books and movies based on their ability to convey emotions, develop characters, and stimulate imagination.\n\nBody Paragraph 1: Books have the ability to convey emotions in a more powerful and nuanced way than movies. For example, in the book \"The Fault in Our Stars,\" the author uses language to describe the characters' emotions in a way that is more vivid and personal than the movie adaptation. The reader can feel the characters' pain and joy more deeply than the viewer.\n\nBody Paragraph 2: Movies, on the other hand, have the ability to develop characters visually and through dialogue. For example, in the movie \"The Lord of the Rings,\" the characters are brought to life through their costumes, makeup, and acting. The viewer can see the characters' expressions and body language, which adds depth and complexity to their personalities.\n\nBody Paragraph 3: Books stimulate imagination by allowing the reader to create their own mental images of the story. For example, in the book \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\" the reader can imagine Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in their own unique way. Movies, on the other hand, provide a more concrete and fixed image of the story, which can limit the viewer's imagination.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, while books and movies both tell stories, they differ in their ability to convey emotions, develop characters, and stimulate imagination. Whether you prefer books or movies depends on your personal preferences and what you value most in a story.",

Add more details: Go back through your essay and look for places where you can add more details. This could include adding more examples, descriptions, or explanations.\n\n2. Use more quotes: If you're writing about a book or movie, try to include more quotes from the text or dialogue from the movie. This will help to support your arguments and add more depth to your essay.\n\n3. Expand on your ideas: If you have a point that you feel is important, but you haven't fully explained it, try to expand on it. Use more sentences to explain your point and provide more evidence to support it.\n\n4. Use transitional phrases: Using transitional phrases can help to connect your ideas and make your essay flow better. This can also help to make your essay longer.\n\n5. Add more sources: If you're allowed to use outside sources, try to find more sources that support your arguments. This will help to add more depth to your essay and make it longer.\n\n6. Use a larger font or increase the spacing: While this isn't the best way to make your essay longer, you can try increasing the font size or spacing to make your essay appear longer. However, make sure to follow the guidelines provided by your teacher.\n\nRemember, it's important to focus on the quality of your essay rather than the length. If you've covered all the necessary points and provided enough evidence to support your arguments, then the length of your essay shouldn't matter.",

While they both tell stories, they do so in different ways. In this essay, I will compare and contrast books and movies based on their ability to convey emotions, develop characters, and stimulate imagination.\n\nBody Paragraph 1: Books have the ability to convey emotions in a more powerful and nuanced way than movies. For example, in the book \"The Fault in Our Stars,\" the author uses language to describe the characters' emotions in a way that is more vivid and personal than the movie adaptation. The reader can feel the characters' pain and joy more deeply than the viewer.\n\nBody Paragraph 2: Movies, on the other hand, have the ability to develop characters visually and through dialogue. For example, in the movie \"The Lord of the Rings,\" the characters are brought to life through their costumes, makeup, and acting. The viewer can see the characters' expressions and body language, which adds depth and complexity to their personalities.\n\nBody Paragraph 3: Books stimulate imagination by allowing the reader to create their own mental images of the story. For example, in the book \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\" the reader can imagine Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in their own unique way. Movies, on the other hand, provide a more concrete and fixed image of the story, which can limit the viewer's imagination.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, while books and movies both tell stories, they differ in their ability to convey emotions, develop characters, and stimulate imagination. Whether you prefer books or movies depends on your personal preferences and what you value most in a story.",

        "response": "Fast food is a type of food that is known for its quick preparation time and easy accessibility, though associated with various health risks. The popularity of fast food has grown significantly since the 1950s when it was first introduced. Fast foods can be found in chain restaurants that sell only fast foods for sales. For well-known chain restaurants, there are McDonald’s, Lotteria, Burger King, and KFC. Because these chain restaurants are in almost every place, the accessibility of fast foods are very good. However, while fast food is a convenient and affordable option for many people, it has been associated with several health problems that have many people in the society have, or have a risk of getting those problems. In this essay, the reason why people prefer fast foods, and the effects of fast foods will be dealt with.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for the popularity of fast food is its convenience. There are big 3 reasons why fast foods are convenient. First, fast food restaurants are typically located in busy areas or all over the world. So when people travel around the world and don’t have anything to eat, fast foods are one of the best choice.\n\nSecond, they are open for extended hours, when other restaurants are on a break time or are closed. For students or office workers that work last and are hungry, the only choice to fill one’s hunger.\n\nLastly, when there is less time or inappropriate place to eat, fast food has a benefit. For people with busy schedules or who has a next schedule, like the word “fast food”, the cooking process and distribution process are so fast, so that it's good to fill up the energy quickly. Additionally, fast food is easy to eat while driving or walking, further contributing to its convenience factor.\n\nThe low cost of fast food is one of the primary reasons why it has become so popular among people of all ages and backgrounds. Why are fast foods cheap? There are several reasons. Fast food restaurants tend to have simple menus with limited options, which helps to reduce costs by minimizing the number of ingredients needed and simplifying the cooking process. They also tend to rely on pre-packaged and pre-portioned ingredients, which reduces waste and helps to keep costs down.\n\nAlso, fast food restaurants typically have lower overhead costs than sit-down restaurants. They often operate in high-traffic areas with lower rent costs, and they require less space for seating and dining areas. This allows them to focus on the food preparation and service, rather than on creating an elaborate dining experience. For these these reasons, fast food restaurants offer a quick, convenient, and affordable option for people who are looking for a quick bite to eat without breaking the bank. While fast food has been associated with a range of health problems, there are also some benefits to its low cost. One of the most significant benefits of the low cost of fast food is its affordability for people on a tight budget. For many people, fast food is the only viable option when it comes to eating out. Eating at a sit-down restaurant or purchasing groceries and preparing meals at home can be expensive, and not everyone has the resources or time to do so. In these cases, fast food can be a lifesaver, providing an affordable and convenient option for people who are on a tight budget.\n\nHowever, while fast food is convenient and affordable, it has been linked to several health problems. One of the most significant health issues associated with fast food is obesity. Fast food is often high in calories, fat, and sugar, which can contribute to weight gain. Studies have shown that people who eat fast food regularly are more likely to be overweight or obese than those who do not. Moreover, fast food is often high in salt, which can lead to high blood pressure and other health problems.\n\nAnother health problem associated with fast food is diabetes. Fast food is often high in carbohydrates, which can cause blood sugar levels to spike. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. A diet high in fast food can also increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nFast food is also linked to heart disease. Fast food is often high in saturated and trans fats, which can increase cholesterol levels and lead to the buildup of plaque in the arteries. This can result in heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes. In addition, fast food consumption has been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate cancer.\n\nMoreover, fast food has been linked to mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. This is thought to be due to the high levels of sugar and fat in fast food, which can affect mood and contribute to mental health problems. Fast food consumption has also been associated with poor academic performance in children and teenagers, potentially due to the negative effects of a poor diet on cognitive function.\n\nDespite the negative effects of fast food, it remains a popular choice for many people. This may be due in part to the addictive qualities of fast food, which can make it difficult for people to resist. Additionally, fast food is often marketed to children and teenagers through targeted advertising and promotions, which can make it an appealing choice for young people.\n\nAside from health problems, fast food has other negative effects as well. For instance, it can harm the environment due to the generation of large amounts of waste, including packaging, food waste, and plastic utensils. This waste contributes to pollution and can have adverse impacts on wildlife. Additionally, fast food chains can negatively impact local economies, as they can drive smaller, locally-owned restaurants out of business, leading to job losses and a decrease in economic activity in the local community.\n\nFast food, with its easy accessibility and affordability in both urban and rural areas, provides a quick source of energy. However, despite the convenience it offers, frequent consumption of fast food can lead to various negative impacts, most notably health issues. The high salt and fat content of fast food can contribute to a range of health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and even mental health conditions such as depression.",

Introduction: Present both opposing views (those who argue that the government should help all its citizens and those who argue that the government should only help those most in need). End the introduction with your thesis statement, which is that the government should help only those most in need.\n2. Body Paragraph 1: Discuss the first reason why the government should help only those most in need, which is to make a balanced society. You can also mention the wealth gap here and state why a balanced society is important.\n3. Body Paragraph 2: Discuss the second reason why the government should help only those most in need, which is that it is a social duty. You can use the concept of 'Noblesse Oblige' to support your argument.\n4. Counterargument: Address a possible counterargument (e.g., the government has the duty to help all its citizens regardless of their background) and provide a rebuttal.\n5. Conclusion: Summarize your argument and restate your thesis statement. Provide a final thought or call to action.\n\nDoes this revised structure make sense to you?",

Then should the government help only those most in need rather than helping all of its citizens? I want to say 'no' to this question for several reasons.\n    First, if we help only people in need then discrimination and hatred between group who gets benefit and who does not will be deeper. Government rules the country with a money from their citizen. Every law and system is possible when there is a money to make and operate it. If people in need only gets benefit from them, then people who don't get benefit will loose their motivation to pay tax. They will discriminate the people who get benefit.\n    Second reason is that peolpe will loose their motivation to work. If government helps every people in need, then they don't have to work. They just have to get money from government and live with it. On the other hand people who have to pay for that money and don't get benefit don't have reason to earn more money. Their motivation to work will decrease.\n    For these reason the government should not help only those most in need. Discrimination between two group will grow, and people will not work hard to earn money. All citizens have their right to be helped by their givernment.

Let's begin by revising some of the sentences to address the common issues you mentioned in class.\n\nFirst, I noticed that in the first sentence, there is a spelling error (\"probelms\" should be \"problems\") and an incomplete sentence. You can revise it by saying: \"The government makes laws and protects its citizens from various problems, such as disasters, poverty, and crime.\"\n\nNext, in the third sentence, there is a spelling error (\"hve\" should be \"have\") and some issues with sentence structure. You can revise it by saying: \"Each citizen has different situations and needs that may require assistance from the government. Therefore, the question arises: should the government help only those most in need rather than helping all of its citizens?\"\n\nIn the fourth sentence, I noticed a run-on sentence. You can revise it by changing the comma to a semicolon after \"reason\": \"I want to say 'no' to this question for several reasons;\"\n\nMoving to the fifth sentence, there is a spelling error (\"peolpe\" should be \"people\") and a sentence fragment. You can revise it by saying: \"The first reason is that people will lose their motivation to work if the government provides assistance to only those in need.\"\n\nIn the sixth sentence, there is also a sentence fragment. You can revise it by saying: \"In such a system, those who do not benefit from government aid may feel disenfranchised and resentful towards those who do.\"\n\nIn the seventh sentence, there is a spelling error (\"Their\" should be \"They're\") and also a run-on sentence. You can revise it by changing the comma to a period after \"income\": \"They're faced with paying for the income of others without receiving any benefits themselves. As a result, their motivation to work decreases.\"\n\nFinally, in the last sentence, there is a spelling error (\"givernment\" should be \"government\") and an incomplete sentence. You can revise it by saying: \"All citizens have a right to be helped by their government, and helping everyone equally is a healthy approach for our society.\"\n\nGreat job on your essay, and I hope these revisions were helpful!

One possible argument against helping only those most in need is that such a system might be too difficult to implement and maintain in practice. For example, determining who qualifies for government aid and who does not can be complex and time-consuming. Some people might intentionally misrepresent their situation in order to get assistance, while others might be unjustly excluded from aid due to administrative errors or red tape. By providing aid more broadly, the government can avoid some of these challenges and ensure that everyone who needs help can get it.\n\n2. Another argument for helping everyone rather than just those most in need is that doing so can promote greater social harmony and a sense of community. When people see that their government cares about everyone's welfare, rather than just that of a select few, they are more likely to feel a sense of collective solidarity and support. This can contribute to lower levels of social tension, greater trust among citizens, and a more cohesive and stable society overall.\n\n3. Finally, some people might argue that helping only those most in need is just not fair or moral. While it is true that people with greater resources might not \"need\" government support, they may still benefit from it in various ways. For example, if government aid programs help to stimulate the economy or provide essential services, even people who are financially secure might benefit from the increased prosperity and opportunities that result. Additionally, from a moral perspective, some people might argue that society has an obligation to provide basic support and resources to all citizens, regardless of need, in order to ensure that everyone can thrive and reach their full potential.",

This statement should provide a concise summary of your arguments and clearly state your stance on the question posed. An example thesis statement for your essay might be: \"While it may seem logical to provide aid only to those most in need, doing so can be discriminatory and demotivating. A more equitable approach is to provide aid to all citizens in need.\"\n\n2. Try to incorporate more concrete examples and evidence to support your arguments. For instance, you could provide examples of situations where people might intentionally misrepresent their situation in order to get assistance or discuss real-world instances of discrimination between groups that result from aid programs only targeting those most in need. This can help make your arguments more persuasive and relatable.\n\n3. Consider adding some counterarguments and addressing them in your essay. For instance, some people might argue that focusing government assistance on the neediest can help maximize the impact of limited resources and ensure that aid goes to those who need it most. By discussing these counterarguments and explaining why you don't think they are as viable as your own arguments, you can strengthen your essay and show that you have considered multiple perspectives.\n\nOverall, your essay makes some strong points and effectively addresses the question at hand. By incorporating a few additional elements like a clear thesis, concrete examples, and counterarguments, you can help make your essay even more effective and engaging.",

        "response": "Yes, there are a few grammatical errors in the essay. Let's work on revising them step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at this sentence: \"Therefore, the question arises: should the government help only those most in need rather than helping all of its citizens?\" There's a small error in subject-verb agreement. It should be, \"should the government help only those most in need rather than help all of its citizens?\" \n\nNext, in the sentence, \"While it may seem logical to provide aid only to those most in need, doing so can be discriminatory and demotivating.\" Replace the word 'doing' with 'it' to make it more clear.\n\nThe sentence, \"If people in need only gets benefit from them, then people who don't get benefit will loose their motivation to pay tax\" has a couple of issues. First, 'gets' should be 'get' to match the subject. Secondly, 'loose' is a spelling error - it should be spelled 'lose'. The sentence can be revised as \"If people in need only get benefit from the government, then those who don't receive benefits will lose their motivation to pay taxes.\"\n\nThe sentence, \"Third problem of implementing a system of aid that targets only those most in need is that the process of determining who qualifies for aid can be highly subjective and subject to abuse\" can be revised as \"A third problem of implementing a system of aid that targets only those most in need is that the process of determining who qualifies for aid can be highly subjective and prone to abuse.\"\n\nFinally, in the sentence \"For these reason the government should not help only those most in need,\" 'reason' should be pluralized to match the sentence. It should be revised to: \"For these reasons, the government should not help only those most in need.\"\n\nLet's review the revised version of the entire paragraph: \n\nThe government makes laws and protects its citizens from various problems, such as disasters, poverty, and crime. Citizens have their rights to be helped and protected by the government. Each citizen has different situations and needs that may require assistance from the government. Therefore, the question arises: should the government help only those most in need rather than help all of its citizens? I want to say 'no' to this question for several reasons. While it may seem logical to provide aid only to those most in need, it can be discriminatory and demotivating. A more equitable approach is to provide aid to all citizens in need.\n\nFirstly, if we help only people in need, discrimination and animosity between groups who receive benefits and who do not will deepen. The government governs the country with money from its citizens. Every rule and system is possible only when there is money to make and operate it. If only those in need receive benefits, those who do not may lose their motivation to pay taxes and may discriminate against those who benefit.\n\nThe second reason is that people may lose their motivation to work if the government provides assistance to only those in need. They may believe they do not need to work as they can rely on the government for money. In such a system, those who do not benefit from government aid may feel disenfranchised and resentful towards those who do. They are faced with paying for the income of others without receiving any benefits themselves. As a result, their motivation to work decreases.\n\nA third problem of implementing a system of aid that targets only those most in need is that the process of determining who qualifies for aid can be highly subjective and prone to abuse. Determining who qualifies for government aid and who does not can be complex and time-consuming. Some people might intentionally misrepresent their situation to receive assistance, while others might be unjustly excluded from aid due to administrative errors. There are also moral issues where people with greater resources may still qualify for government support due to errors in determining who qualifies for aid.\n\nFor these reasons, the government should not help only those most in need. Discrimination between two groups will grow, and people will not work hard to earn money. In addition, in reality, it is hard to implement a system of aid that targets only those most in need. All citizens have the right to be helped by their government, and helping everyone equally is a healthy approach for our society.",

Draw from personal experience: Adding personal experience or anecdotes can make your essay more relatable and engaging. For example, you can draw from your own experiences of witnessing or experiencing discrimination due to policies that benefit only a select few.\n\n5. Use diverse sources: To provide a well-rounded argument, you can use diverse sources such as academic journals, news articles, or opinion pieces to supplement your writing.\n\nRemember to integrate any new information or examples you add to your essay seamlessly with your existing content.

When governments choose to provide funding only to those businesses that demonstrate financial need, they may inadvertently favor large businesses that have the resources to navigate complicated application processes and meet the stringent criteria. However, small businesses, which may not have the same resources, may be left out of these programs, leading to the consolidation of market share in the hands of a select few firms. On the other hand, by promoting assistance to all citizens regardless of business size, governments can ensure that everyone has an equal shot at success, and the market remains competitive.\n\nCounter-argument:\n\nCritics of this approach may argue that providing subsidies to all businesses, both large and small, is a wasteful use of taxpayer dollars. They may argue that only companies that demonstrate financial need or that contribute to the public good should be eligible for government funding. However, while this argument may seem logical, it fails to account for the fact that many small businesses struggle due to the costs of operation, even though they may otherwise provide quality goods and services. Additionally, by promoting a competitive market, governments can increase the overall success of businesses, leading to an increase in revenue and ultimately, higher tax returns for the government. Thus, the cost to the taxpayer can be balanced against the benefits brought about by a competitive marketplace.",

In such a system, students may feel more effective pursuing an education that does not require them to take out costly student loans, even if it means abandoning their preferred path of study.

They may argue that only students who demonstrate financial need or who contribute to the public good or a particular industry should be eligible for government funding. However, while this argument may seem logical, it fails to account for the fact that many talented students who do not meet the stringent eligibility criteria may still struggle with the costs of tuition and other expenses that pose a barrier to their educational goals. Additionally, by promoting higher educational achievement and merit, governments can create a better-educated workforce overall, leading to higher economic returns and a more productive and innovative society.

When healthcare systems focus solely on providing care to those who demonstrate financial need, it can lead to resentment and division. Citizens who are ineligible for assistance may harbor ill will towards those who are receiving aid, seeing them as freeloaders, while those who are receiving aid may feel stigmatized and discriminated against. On the other hand, when assistance is provided to all citizens, it fosters a sense of communal responsibility and shared accountability. By contributing to the healthcare system through taxation, everyone is invested in the well-being of one another, and the government is more accountable to the needs of its citizens. \n\nPros and Cons Regarding Assistance to Only Those in Need versus Assistance to All Citizens:\n\nPros of providing assistance only to those in need:\n\n- There is potential for greater efficiency, as resources are concentrated where they are most needed.\n- The amount of funding needed for assistance programs may be lower, as it is targeted towards those in dire circumstances.\n\nCons of providing assistance only to those in need:\n\n- The potential for stigma and discrimination may be higher, as individuals may feel that they are being judged and marginalized based on their economic status.\n- Those who are ineligible for assistance due to their financial standing may feel that they are being left out of important government programs.\n\nPros of providing assistance to all citizens:\n\n- There is potential for greater social cohesion, as everyone is invested in the well-being of society as a whole.\n- The sense of communal responsibility may encourage higher rates of participation in government programs and higher tax compliance.\n\nCons of providing assistance to all citizens:\n\n- The cost of funding programs that benefit everyone may be higher, as assistance is not limited to those in the greatest need.\n- There may be concerns that those who do not need assistance are taking advantage of programs designed to help those in need.",

Government rules the country with a money from their citizen. Every law and system is possible when there is a money to make and operate it. If people in need only get benefit from them, then people who don't get benefit will lose their motivation to pay tax. They will discriminate the people who get benefit. One example of how limiting assistance to only those in need can create deeper discrimination and hatred between groups can be seen in the case of healthcare. When healthcare systems focus solely on providing care to those who demonstrate financial need, it can lead to resentment and division. Citizens who are ineligible for assistance may harbor ill will towards those who are receiving aid, seeing them as freeloaders, while those who are receiving aid may feel stigmatized and discriminated against. On the other hand, when assistance is provided to all citizens, it fosters a sense of communal responsibility and shared accountability. By contributing to the healthcare system through taxation, everyone is invested in the well-being of one another, and the government is more accountable to the needs of its citizens.\n \n   The second reason is that people will lose their motivation to work if the government provides assistance to only those in need. They just have to get money from government and live with it. In such a system, those who do not benefit from government aid may feel disenfranchised and resentful towards those who do. They're faced with paying for the income of others without receiving any benefits themselves. As a result, their motivation to work decreases.\nSome people might say that providing assistance only to those in need has potential for greater efficiency, as resources are concentrated where they are most needed. Additionally, the amount of funding needed for assistance programs may be lower, as it is targeted towards those in dire circumstances. However, Those who are ineligible for assistance due to their financial standing may feel that they are being left out of important government programs. They will lose their reason to pay taxes and their motivation to work hard, and consequently, government will lose efficiency gained by helping only those in need.\n\n I changed like this, anyway to improve it?\n",

        "response": "Great job! Here are some suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Consider moving the example about healthcare to a new paragraph, so that your first paragraph remains focused on your argument that limiting assistance to only those in need can create deeper discrimination and hatred between groups.\n\n2. To enhance your second paragraph, consider providing specific examples of assistance programs that are currently in place and provide benefits only to those in need. You can then explain how these programs might disincentivize work and create resentment among those who don't receive benefits. You could also provide examples of programs that provide assistance to all citizens, such as public education and healthcare, and discuss how these programs foster a sense of community and shared responsibility.\n\n3. Consider addressing the counterargument in a more comprehensive way. Instead of just mentioning that some people may argue that assistance to those in need is more efficient, you can provide more detail about this perspective and why some may feel this way. You can then refute this argument by presenting evidence or logical arguments to support your own stance.\n\nHere is a revised version of the paragraph:\n\nFirst, limiting assistance to only those in need can create deeper discrimination and antagonism between groups. The government runs the country with tax money collected from its citizens. If only those in need receive benefits, it can create resentment among those who do not receive aid. Discrimination and stigmatization can arise, leading those who do not receive assistance to harbor ill will towards those who do. For example, when healthcare systems focus only on providing care to those who demonstrate financial need, it can create division and hatred. On the other hand, when assistance is provided to all citizens, accountability is shared and it fosters a sense of communal responsibility. Citizens are more invested in each other's well-being, leading to a more cohesive society.\n\nSecond, providing assistance only to those in need may disincentivize work and create resentment among those who do not qualify for aid. In such a system, individuals who do not benefit from government aid may feel disenfranchised and resentful toward those who do. They are faced with paying for the income of others without receiving any benefits themselves, dampening their motivation to work. While some might argue that concentrating resources where they are most needed creates efficiency and reduces costs, those who are ineligible for assistance may feel left out of important government programs. This can lead to even lower motivation to work and pay taxes, thus reducing the efficiency of the government's assistance programs.",

        "response": " Another reason of why providing assistance to all citizens can be beneficial is in the case of education funding. When governments choose to provide financial aid only to those who demonstrate financial need, they may inadvertently signal to students that their work will not be rewarded except in cases of dire fiscal straits. In such a system, students may feel more effective pursuing an education that does not require them to take out costly student loans, even if it means abandoning their preferred path of study. On the other hand, by promoting assistance to all citizens based on merit and academic achievement, governments can ensure that talented students have an equal opportunity to achieve their goals, and the workforce remains competitive. However, some may argue that providing financial assistance to all students based on merit is a wasteful use of taxpayer dollars. They may argue that only students who demonstrate financial need or who contribute to the public good or a particular industry should be eligible for government funding. However, while this argument may seem logical, it fails to account for the fact that many talented students who do not meet the stringent eligibility criteria may still struggle with the costs of tuition and other expenses that pose a barrier to their educational goals. Additionally, by promoting higher educational achievement and merit, governments can create a better-educated workforce overall, leading to higher economic returns and a more productive and innovative society. The cost to the taxpayer can be balanced against the benefits brought about by a more educated citizenry.\n\nI think this paragraph is too long. any way to make this paragraph into proper length?",

        "response": "    The relationship between the government and its citizens is a complex interplay of power, responsibility, and accountability. Citizens have their rights to be helped and protected by government. Additionally, each citizen has different situations and needs that may require assistance from the government. Therefore, the question arises: should the government help only those most in need rather than help all of its citizens? This essay argues that the government should provide aid to all citizens, regardless of their financial status or demonstrated need, for several reasons; While it may seem logical to provide aid only to those most in need, it can be discriminatory and demotivating. Also, it creates a system that is prone to errors and fraud. Providing support to all citizens can promote social cohesion and responsibility. A more equitable approach is to provide aid to all citizens in need.\n\n     First, limiting assistance to those in need can create deeper discrimination and antagonism between groups. The government runs the country with tax money collected from its citizens. If only those in need receive benefits, it can create resentment among those who do not receive aid. Discrimination and stigmatization can arise, leading those who do not receive assistance to harbor ill will towards those who do. For instance, when healthcare systems concentrate care only on those who demonstrate financial need, it can create division and hatred. On the other hand, when assistance is offered to all citizens, accountability is shared, and it fosters a sense of communal responsibility. Citizens are more invested in each other's well-being, leading to a more cohesive society.\n \n   The second reason is that people will lose their motivation to work if the government provides assistance to only those in need. They just have to get money from government and live with it. In such a system, those who do not benefit from government aid may feel disenfranchised and resentful towards those who do. They're faced with paying for the income of others without receiving any benefits themselves. As a result, their motivation to work decreases.\nSome people might say that providing assistance only to those in need has potential for greater efficiency, as resources are concentrated where they are most needed. Additionally, the amount of funding needed for assistance programs may be lower, as it is targeted towards those in dire circumstances. However, Those who are ineligible for assistance due to their financial standing may feel that they are being left out of important government programs. They will lose their reason to pay taxes and their motivation to work hard, and consequently, government will lose efficiency gained by helping only those in need.\n\n   A third problem of implementing a system of aid that targets only those most in need is that the process of determining who qualifies for aid can be highly subjective and prone to abuse. Determining who qualifies for government aid and who does not can be complex and time-consuming. Some people might intentionally misrepresent their situation in order to get assistance, while others might be unjustly excluded from aid due to administrative errors. Then there can be a moral issues. People with greater resources might not need government support, they may still benefit from it in various ways due to the error on determining who qualifies for government assistance.\n   \n    Another reason is that providing financial aid only to those who demonstrate financial need can create unintended consequences, such as discouraging students from pursuing their preferred paths of study based on cost. In contrast, a system that promotes providing assistance to all citizens based on merit and academic achievement ensures talented students have an equal opportunity to achieve their goals, thereby keeping the workforce competitive. Some argue that providing financial assistance to all students based on merit is a wasteful use of taxpayer dollars and that only those who demonstrate financial need or contribute to the public good should receive government funding. However, this argument fails to consider that limiting funding exclusively in this way may exclude many talented students from access to higher education, contributing to a less productive and innovative society overall. The cost to the taxpayer must be weighed against the benefits of investing in a more educated citizenry.\n    \n    In conclusion, the government must offer aid to all citizens to ensure a just and cohesive society. Providing assistance only to those most in need can intensify discrimination and breed resentment, ultimately eroding social solidarity. Additionally, such a system may disincentivize work by fostering resentment among those who do not qualify for aid. While some may argue that focusing aid only on those most in need can be more efficient, it can also exclude those who, despite not demonstrating obvious financial hardship, still require support. The process of determining who qualifies for aid can be complex and prone to errors, potentially leaving out deserving citizens. A system that promotes aid to all citizens is more inclusive and promotes social responsibility, while encouraging productivity and innovation. Therefore, it is imperative that the government consider equity and community investment when designing aid programs, rather than concentrating support on an exclusive group of people.\n\n in this essay which part has first,second-person perspective?",

Citizens have the right to receive help and protection from the government. Additionally, each citizen has different situations and needs that may require assistance from the government. Therefore, the question arises: should the government help only those most in need rather than help all of its citizens? This essay argues that the government should provide aid to all citizens, regardless of their financial status or demonstrated need, for several reasons; While it may seem logical to provide aid only to those most in need, it can be discriminatory and demotivating. Also, it creates a system that is prone to errors and fraud. Providing support to all citizens can promote social cohesion and responsibility. A more equitable approach is to provide aid to all citizens, regardless of financial status or demonstrated need.\n\n     First, limiting assistance to those in need can create deeper discrimination and antagonism between groups. The government runs the country with tax money collected from its citizens. If only those in need receive benefits, it can create resentment among those who do not receive aid. Discrimination and stigmatization can arise, leading those who do not receive assistance to harbor ill will towards those who do. For instance, when healthcare systems concentrate care only on those who demonstrate financial need, it can create division and hatred. On the other hand, when assistance is offered to all citizens, accountability is shared, and it fosters a sense of communal responsibility. Citizens are more invested in each other's well-being, leading to a more cohesive society.\n \n   The second reason is that people will lose their motivation to work if the government provides assistance to only those in need. They could become reliant on government aid and lose motivation to work. In such a system, those who do not benefit from government aid may feel disenfranchised and resentful towards those who do. Those who do not receive aid may feel as though they are contributing to support others without receiving any support themselves. As a result, their motivation to work decreases. Some people might say that providing assistance only to those in need has potential for greater efficiency, as resources are concentrated where they are most needed. Additionally, the amount of funding needed for assistance programs may be lower, as it is targeted towards those in dire circumstances. However, Those who are ineligible for assistance due to their financial standing may feel that they are being left out of important government programs. They will lose their reason to pay taxes and their motivation to work hard, and consequently, government will lose efficiency gained by helping only those in need.\n\n   A third problem of implementing a system of aid that targets only those most in need is that the process of determining who qualifies for aid can be highly subjective and prone to abuse.

I'll provide some suggestions on how you can make your use of adjective and adverb clauses more formal:\n\n- Instead of using \"those\" repeatedly to refer to a group of people, consider using more precise language. For example, you could use \"individuals\" or \"recipients\" instead.\n\n- Use a range of sentence structures to show your mastery of the English language. Try varying the length and complexity of your sentences, and use more sophisticated connectives such as \"moreover\" or \"nevertheless\" to link your ideas.\n\n- Use more formal language where appropriate. For example, instead of saying \"citizens have different circumstances and needs,\" you could say \"citizens possess diverse circumstances and requirements.\"\n\n- Use adjective clauses to provide additional information about a noun. For instance, instead of saying \"when healthcare systems concentrate care only on those who demonstrate financial need,\" you could say \"when healthcare systems focus care only on those individuals who exhibit dire financial need.\"\n\n- Similarly, use adverb clauses to provide additional information about how, when, or why an action is taking place. For example, instead of saying \"The cost to the taxpayer must be weighed against the benefits of investing in a more educated citizenry,\" you could say \"As a result, the cost to the taxpayer must be carefully balanced against the important benefits of promoting a more educated citizenry.\"\n\nRemember that formal language doesn't mean using big words or complicated sentence structures just for the sake of it.

Below is my essay where should i fix?\n\nThe relationship between the government and its citizens is a complex interplay of power, responsibility, and accountability. The government is responsible for providing its citizens with assistance and protection as a fundamental right. Additionally, each citizens possess diverse circumstances and needs that may require assistance from the government. Therefore, the question arises: should the government help only those most in need rather than help all of its citizens? This essay argues that the government should provide aid to all citizens, regardless of their financial status or demonstrated need, for several reasons; While it may seem logical to provide aid only to individuals most in need, it can be discriminatory and demotivating. Also, it creates a system that is prone to errors and fraud. Providing support to all citizens can promote social cohesion and responsibility. A more equitable approach is to provide aid to all citizens, regardless of financial status or demonstrated need.\nFirst, by restricting aid to those who demonstrate financial need, the government runs the risk of perpetuating division and animosity among different social and economic groups. The government runs the country with careful management of tax money. If only those in need receive benefits, it can create resentment among those who do not receive aid. Discrimination and stigmatization can arise, leading those who do not receive assistance to harbor ill will towards those who do. According to Weishaupt and Kuebler (2018), social welfare policies can either promote or hinder social cohesion. Targeting only those in need can lead to resentment and division among different social and economic groups. This can create a sense of \"us versus them\" mentality, where those who do not receive assistance may feel excluded and resentful towards those who do. For instance, when healthcare systems focus care only on those individuals who exhibit dire financial need, it can create division and hatred. On the other hand, when assistance is offered to all citizens, accountability is shared, and it fosters a sense of communal responsibility. Citizens are more invested in each other's well-being, leading to a more cohesive society.\nThe second reason is that people will lose their motivation to work if the government provides assistance to only individuals in need. They could become reliant on government aid and lose motivation to work. In such a system, those who do not benefit from government aid may feel disenfranchised and resentful towards those who do. Those who do not receive aid may feel as though they are contributing to support others without receiving aid, without receiving any support themselves. As a result, their motivation to work decreases. Some people might say that providing assistance only to those\t in need has potential for greater efficiency, as resources are focused where they are most needed. Additionally, the amount of funding needed for assistance programs may be lower, as it is targeted towards those in dire circumstances. However, Those who are ineligible for assistance due to their financial standing may feel that they are being left out of important government programs. They will lose their reason to pay taxes and their motivation to work hard, and consequently, government will lose efficiency gained by helping only individuals in need. \nA third problem of implementing a system of aid that targets only those most in need is that the process of determining who qualifies for aid can be highly subjective and prone to abuse. Determining who qualifies for government aid and who does not can be complex and time-consuming. Some people might intentionally misrepresent their circumstance in order to get assistance, while others might be unjustly excluded from aid due to administrative errors. Then there can be a moral issues. People with greater resources might not need government support, they may still benefit from it in various ways due to the error on determining who qualifies for government assistance.\nAnother reason is that providing financial aid only to individuals who demonstrate financial need can create unintended consequences, such as discouraging students from pursuing their preferred paths of study based on cost. In contrast, a system that promotes providing assistance to all citizens based on merit and academic achievement guarantees talented students have an equal opportunity to achieve their goals, thereby keeping the workforce competitive. Some argue that providing financial assistance to all students based on merit is a wasteful use of taxpayer dollars and that only those who demonstrate financial need or contribute to the public good should receive government funding. However, this argument fails to consider that limiting funding exclusively in this way may exclude many talented students from access to higher education, contributing to a less productive and innovative society overall. As a result, the cost to the taxpayer must be carefully balanced against the important benefits of promoting a more educated citizenry.\nIn conclusion, the government must offer aid to all citizens to secure a just and cohesive society. Providing assistance only to those most in need can escalate discrimination and breed resentment, ultimately eroding social solidarity. Additionally, such a system may disincentivize work by fostering resentment among those who do not qualify for aid. While some may argue that focusing aid only on those most in need can be more efficient, it can also exclude those who, despite not demonstrating obvious financial hardship, still require support. The process of determining who qualifies for aid can be complex and prone to errors, potentially leaving out deserving citizens. A system that promotes aid to all citizens is more comprehensive and promotes social responsibility, while encouraging productivity and innovation. Therefore, it is imperative that the government consider equity and community investment when designing aid programs, rather than concentrating support on an exclusive group of people.\n",

So I think universities should require major-free in the first year of school for several reasons.\n First, the students, who just graduate highschool don't know exactly about what their major is it. But when school requires major-free to freshman, wa can solve this problem. Most student just choose major by the major's name or the information that is not right. However, if they don't have major, they can search information of the major and get advices from a professor or someone who know well about it. So major-free in first year will be a road that looking around slowly for the students.\n  Next, when universities require that the first year of college be major-free, students can experience other majors that are not their own major. Making a sight for other majors and experience is very important to freshman. It will give them a choice that choose another major or help to make a creative connection between different areas.\n Finally, the major-tree of the first year makes some time that students learn some basic subjects. Every major in universities require student to learn the basic of the major because it is important for learning some difficult knowledge. The students who\nare major-free can make their first step well for a year.\n In conclusion, when colleges require that the first year of school be major-free, students can choose their way more better than when they have a fixed major. It is going to help\nthe students to get some right information of a major, experience other studies and have a time for their base learning.",

        "response": "Great start to your essay! There are a few places where we can improve the use of commas in order to make your points more clear. Let's go through each paragraph together to revise:\n \nParagraph 1: When there is a list of reasons to support an argument, it's important to separate them with commas. In your first sentence, \"It can be seen there is no problem at all\" is better written as \"It can be seen that there are no problems at all\". This way, we connect the two separate ideas and make our point more clear. Additionally, in the second sentence, we can separate the list of reasons with commas, so that it reads: \"So, I think universities should require major-free in the first year of school for several reasons.\"\n\nParagraph 2: You make a great point here about students not knowing exactly what their major is, and therefore needing more information. Let's make sure that we properly separate the list of things that students can do to find the right major. You can start the sentence with \"However, if they don't have a major, they can search information of the major and get advice from a professor, or someone who knows well about it.\" \n\nParagraph 3: Another great point you make is about the importance of experiencing other majors before committing to one. We should separate the two reasons that come after the first clause. So, the sentence would read: \"Making a sight for other majors and experience is very important to freshman. It will give them a choice to choose another major or help to make a creative connection between different areas.\"\n\nParagraph 4: In the last paragraph, as you discuss the benefits of having a major-free first year, there is one place we can create a list using commas. You can revise the sentence to read, \"The students who are major-free can make their first step well for a year by learning some basic subjects.\"\n\nOverall, you have made great points in your essay, but making small changes to grammar and punctuation can make a big difference in persuasive writing. Remember to always think about how to break up lists in order to make your writing more clear.",

Identify every place in your essay where a list appears, and see if you have used commas to separate each element of the list. If not, add them where necessary. You can also check to see if you have used commas correctly in other areas of your essay.",

So I think universities should require major-free in the first year of school for several reasons.\n First, the students, who just graduate highschool don't know exactly about what their major is it. But when school requires major-free to freshman, wa can solve this problem. Most student just choose major by the major's name or the information that is not right. However, if they don't have major, they can search information of the major and get advices from a professor or someone who know well about it. So major-free in first year will be a road that looking around slowly for the students.\n  Next, when universities require that the first year of college be major-free, students can experience other majors that are not their own major. Making a sight for other majors and experience is very important to freshman. It will give them a choice that choose another major or help to make a creative connection between different areas.\n Finally, the major-tree of the first year makes some time that students learn some basic subjects. Every major in universities require student to learn the basic of the major because it is important for learning some difficult knowledge. The students who\nare major-free can make their first step well for a year.\n In conclusion, when colleges require that the first year of school be major-free, students can choose their way more better than when they have a fixed major. It is going to help\nthe students to get some right information of a major, experience other studies and have a time for their base learning.",

        "response": "Great job with your first draft. I have some feedback that may help improve your essay, but it's important to keep in mind that this is just one teacher's opinion, and other teachers or readers might have different opinions.\n\nFirst, let's focus on using commas correctly. In the first sentence, \"Today, many universities don't require that the first year of college be major-free,\" you have used a comma correctly after \"Today.\" However, in the second sentence, \"It can be seen there is no problem at all, but there are some serious problem,\" you have used a comma incorrectly after \"all\" instead of \"problem.\" Here's a revised version:\n\n\"It can be seen that there is no problem at all, but there are some serious problems.\"\n\nMake sure to always use commas to separate items in a list. In your second paragraph, you have used a comma correctly to separate two items in a list (\"by the major's name or the information that is not right\"). However, you've missed a comma in the third sentence. Here's a revised version:\n\n\"However, if they don't have a major, they can search information of the major and get advice from a professor or someone who knows well about it.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the structure of your essay. The first sentence in the second paragraph is a bit awkward. Instead of saying \"First, the students,\" you can say \"Firstly, students.\" Also, in the third paragraph, you've written \"major-tree\" instead of \"major-free.\" Here's a revised version:\n\n\"Finally, having a major-free first year allows students some time to learn basic subjects. Every major in universities requires students to learn the basics of the major because it is important for learning some difficult knowledge. This period allows students who are major-free to make a solid foundation for the year.\"\n\nOverall, good work organizing your essay into five paragraphs with a clear thesis statement. Make sure to double-check your grammar and spelling, and always check for commas when listing items or ideas. Keep practicing these skills, and you'll see improvement in no time!",

In your second sentence, consider using \"laptops\" instead of \"laptop\" since you are referring to the device in plural rather than singular.\n\n2. In the third sentence, consider using \"classes\" instead of \"class\" since you are again referring to the subject in plural form.\n\n3. In the fourth sentence, consider using \"professors\" instead of \"proffesors\" to correct the spelling mistake.\n\n4. In the seventh sentence, consider using \"opinions and thoughts\" instead of \"opinions and thinkings\" for proper grammar.\n\n5. In the eighth sentence, consider using \"divide\" instead of \"device\" for correct grammar.\n\nOnce you make these changes, I suggest you read through your essay again to ensure that the flow and grammar are consistent throughout.

There are several reasons that school uniforms should not be required.\nFirst, not wearing school uniforms makes more creative. If students can wear any clothes what they choose, they will spend more time to think about their outfit. They can think which colors are matching better to them and which pants are better to their shirts. It makes students creative because they can choose from millions of cases. It will helps to solve math problem creatively and to write novels. Everyone they can choose their outfit and think which one is best. It makes students creative. \nIn addition wearing their own clothes can express their character. If there are a student who usually wear yellow t-shirts, then everyone can recognize him to “yellow man”. Outfit is very good way to express themselves. Wearing school uniforms can't express student's own characters. Every students have freedom to express themselves with their outfit, If there are students who like sports, they will wear sweat-pants and on the other hand there are some students who want to wear formal.\nLastly, wearing their own clothes make more smart. There are several researches that a wearing school uniforms makes students stress and depressed. Hearing Wearing their own clothes makes students more happy and smart. School uniforms makes students unhappy and they think school is boring place.\nBy these reasons school uniforms should not be required for high school students.

Here are some recommendations for improvement:\n\n1. Develop your ideas further: While you make some good points, you could provide more details and examples to support your arguments. For example, you claim that not having to wear uniforms makes students more creative. Can you provide some supporting evidence to demonstrate this? Perhaps you could offer some examples of successful individuals who attribute their creativity to having the freedom to choose what they wear.\n\n2. Use more academic language: While your essay is easy to understand, using more academic language will make it more persuasive. For example, instead of saying \"It looks like a very tiny differences,\" you could say \"While the difference may appear insignificant at first glance.\" Additionally, you could consider using more complex sentence structures to showcase your writing abilities.\n\n3. Proofread for errors: While not a content-based issue, proofreading your essay for grammatical and spelling errors will help you to demonstrate your best writing. Be sure to check your punctuation and capitalization, as well.\n\nBy following these recommendations, your essay will be stronger, more persuasive and effective in conveying your message.",

        "response": "Great job on your essay. You have used commas well in your writing. However, there are a few places where you could make some improvements to make your writing clearer.\n\n1. In the first sentence, you have used a comma to separate two clauses. However, the second clause is not an independent clause, so it does not need a comma. It would read better if you wrote: \"A lot of schools, even some middle schools, let students use their private tablets and laptop computers, and sometimes teachers even provide them. However, this has been controversial because people were not sure whether it is effective for education or not.\"\n\n2. In the third sentence, you wrote \"The size of the letters can be changed easily while it is difficult with paper notebooks.\" It would be clearer if you used a comma after \"easily\" to separate two independent clauses: \"The size of the letters can be changed easily, while it is difficult with paper notebooks.\"\n\n3. In the fourth sentence, you have used the conjunction \"so\" to connect two clauses. It is appropriate to use a comma before \"so\" when the two clauses are independent.

There is controversy about whether using electronic devices is effective for education. Governments still allow them, despite the controversies, because they offer some advantages that regular books or notebooks can't provide. \n\nParagraph 2: \n\n* Topic sentence: Digital notebooks make it easier to write and erase and allow users to change the size and color of the text. \n* Supporting statement 1: It is easier to remove words that were written as a mistake, unlike paper notebooks. \n* Supporting statement 2: Digital notebooks have more color options, allowing users to include various color pens. \n\nParagraph 3: \n\n* Topic sentence: Students can find necessary information faster using electronic devices while in class. \n* Supporting statement 1: It is hard to find some concepts in books during class. \n* Supporting statement 2: Students can find additional information online that can help them learn specific concepts. \n\nParagraph 4: \n\n* Topic sentence: Connecting students in a class can be beneficial. \n* Supporting statement 1: Students can share useful information. \n* Supporting statement 2: Students can have debates. \n* Supporting statement 3: Students can work in teams or on cooperative projects earlier, like in college. \n\nOnce you have revised the essay, make sure to proofread it and check for any grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. Good luck with your revision!",

        "response": "Yes, that's correct! When we write, we want to make sure that we include all the necessary information to make our point clear, but we don't want to include any extra information that is irrelevant to the main idea. Here are some writing rules that can help you distinguish necessary information from extra information:\n\n1. Stick to the topic: Make sure that everything you write relates to the main idea or topic of your essay. If it doesn't directly relate, it's most likely extra information.\n\n2. Use clear and concise language: Write in a way that is easy to understand and avoids using overly complex or wordy phrases. This will help ensure that you are conveying only the necessary information.\n\n3. Use supporting examples or details: Give examples or details to support the main point that you are making. This will show that your information is necessary and not extra.\n\n4. Avoid repeating yourself: Try not to repeat information that you have already stated. This will help you keep your writing concise and to the point.\n\n5. Keep it relevant: Make sure that the information you include is relevant to your essay's purpose. If it doesn't add to the point you're making, it's probably extra and can be left out.\n\nBy following these rules, you can more effectively identify and include only the necessary information in your essay.",

Titles of people, like President or Doctor, should be capitalized when they come before the person's name, but not when they come after (e.g., President Obama vs. Barack Obama, MD).\n\n4. Titles of books, articles, songs, movies, and other creative works should have the first letter of each major word capitalized. Minor words such as \"and\" and \"the\" are not capitalized, unless they are the first word in the title.\n\n5. Capitalize the important words in titles, including the first and last words, as well as all nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns.\n\n6. Capitalize days of the week, months, and holidays.\n\n7. Capitalize the first word of a sentence that is a direct quote.\n\nKeep in mind that there are many more rules of capitalization, and it is always best to use a reference or guide to ensure that you use proper capitalization.",

In some cases, teachers even provide them.\"\n\n2.

        "response": "Overall, your essay is well-structured and presents a clear argument in favor of using tablets and laptops in the classroom. However, there are a few areas where you could improve your writing. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Use more specific examples to support your points. For instance, when you mention that digital notebooks have more color options, you could give an example of how this could be useful in a classroom setting. Similarly, when you talk about students being able to share information and have debates, you could give an example of a specific project or assignment where this would be beneficial.\n\n2. Use more varied sentence structures. Your essay is written in a very straightforward style, which can make it feel a bit repetitive. Try to mix up your sentence structures by using different types of clauses, varying your sentence length, and using transitional phrases to connect your ideas.\n\n3. Proofread your essay carefully. There are a few small errors in your writing, such as missing commas and typos. Make sure to read through your essay carefully before submitting it to catch any mistakes.\n\nHere's a revised version of your essay that incorporates these suggestions:\n\nTechnological advancements have led to an increasing number of schools nationwide embracing the use of personal devices in the classroom. According to a recent study, over 75% of middle schools now allow students to use their own electronic gadgets, and some teachers even provide them for their students. While the effectiveness of this method has been the subject of much debate, there are several advantages to using tablets and laptops in the classroom.\n\nFirst, digital notebooks make it easier to write and erase letters. Unlike paper notebooks, digital notebooks allow users to remove words that are written as a mistake, and the size of the letters can be changed easily. Additionally, digital notebooks have more color options, which can be useful for highlighting important information or organizing notes.\n\nSecond, tablets and laptops are useful for searching for necessary information. It can be difficult to find certain concepts in books during class, but with electronic devices, students can quickly search for information online. This can save time and allow students to learn more efficiently.\n\nThird, tablets and laptops allow students to connect with each other. In a classroom where each student has their own device, they can share useful information and have debates about what they learned during the day. This offers high school students the opportunity to experience teamwork and collaboration, which are skills that are often emphasized in college.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are certainly drawbacks to using personal devices in the classroom, the advantages cannot be ignored. Digital notebooks make it easier to write and organize notes, tablets and laptops allow for efficient information searching, and connected devices promote collaboration and teamwork. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see even more benefits to using personal devices in the classroom.",

There are two big advantages of using a tablet or a laptop computer in class.\nThe first advantage is that students can participate in class well by using the devices. For example, playing Kahoot quiz about what students have learned increases understanding of the concept they have learned, and using QR codes to join some activity in class will rise interest of students. In addition, we are in the post-covid era, students and professor can contact online via Zoom of Google Meets, and it can also increase participation of students in class who are far away. By using tablets and laptops, students can participate in class more actively.\nThe second advantage is the usefulness of using such devices. In class, professor do their class using lecture notes and sometimes they write down some letters on the white board. Students who use tablets or laptops can easily download the lecture note, write what they understand down on it, take some pictures of the white board and share some copy of their online notes. Also, by using some internet platforms such as KLMS or Google Classroom, students can upload their homework or handout more comfortably.

Now let's take a closer look at the punctuation and revise the content to make it stand out. \n\n1.

In the second sentence, use \"These internet technology devices\" instead of \"these internet technology devices\" to make it more specific. \"They\" is unclear, so instead of saying \"they use these internet technology devices to write down what they learn,\" say \"Students use these internet technology devices to take notes in class.\"\n\n3. In the third sentence, add a comma after \"For example\" to separate this introductory phrase from the main clause. \n\n4. In the fourth sentence, use \"the post-Covid era\" instead of \"the post-covid era\" and use \"Zoom or Google Meet\" instead of \"Zoom of Google Meets.\" Also, in this sentence, add a comma after the word \"era\" to connect the dependent clause better to the independent clause.\n\n5. In the seventh sentence, use \"the most important part of the advantages, which is the usefulness,\" instead of \"the most important part of the advantages, usefulness,\" to make it clear that you are introducing a new idea.\n\n6. Finally, in the last sentence, you can add \"as\" before \"students\" so that the sentence reads \"As these advantages demonstrate.\" This will improve the flow of your conclusion. \n\nRemember to proofread your work before submitting the final draft.

In the first sentence, you can add a comma after \"In these days\" to separate the introductory phrase from the main clause. \n\n2. In the second sentence, use \"These internet technology devices\" instead of \"these internet technology devices\" to make it more specific. \"They\" is unclear, so instead of saying \"they use these internet technology devices to write down what they learn,\" say \"Students use these internet technology devices to take notes in class.\"\n\n3. In the third sentence, add a comma after \"For example\" to separate this introductory phrase from the main clause. \n\n4. In the fourth sentence, use \"the post-Covid era\" instead of \"the post-covid era\" and use \"Zoom or Google Meet\" instead of \"Zoom of Google Meets.\" Also, in this sentence, add a comma after the word \"era\" to connect the dependent clause better to the independent clause.\n\n5. In the seventh sentence, use \"the most important part of the advantages, which is the usefulness,\" instead of \"the most important part of the advantages, usefulness,\" to make it clear that you are introducing a new idea.\n\n6. Finally, in the last sentence, you can add \"as\" before \"students\" so that the sentence reads \"As these advantages demonstrate.\" This will improve the flow of your conclusion. \n\nRemember to proofread your work before submitting the final draft. Great job, and keep up the good work!",

However, there are some areas that need improvement, specifically related to coherence in the cause-and-effect relationships.\n\nHere are some suggestions for revision:\n\n1. Introduction: In the introduction, it is important to clearly state the cause-and-effect relationship. You could revise it to something like: \"In recent years, the increased use of tablets, laptops, and other internet technology devices in classrooms has brought about two significant advantages: increased student participation and greater usefulness of these devices in the classroom.\"\n\n2. Topic Sentences:Each body paragraph needs a clear topic sentence which establishes the main point and the cause-and-effect relationship. For example, in your first body paragraph, your topic sentence could be revised to: \"The use of tablets and laptops can lead to increased student participation in class activities by providing engaging tools and incorporating online learning platforms such as Kahoot quizzes and QR codes.\"\n\n3. Evidence and Analysis: You could develop the paragraph by including specific examples and analysis that support your main point. For example, you could provide a specific example of how Kahoot quizzes have increased understanding or how QR codes increase interest in an activity.\n\n4. Linking the Cause-and-Effect Ideas: You can make the cause-and-effect ideas more coherent and connected by using appropriate transition words such as \"as a result,\" \"therefore,\" \"consequently,\" \"since,\" etc. \n\n5. Conclusion: Your conclusion could be revised to summarize the two advantages of using tablets and laptops in class and restate the main point of your essay.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.",

        "response": "Great, thank you for sharing your essay with me. Let's start revising it based on what you learned in class. \n\nFirst, we can add some cause and effect transition signals to make the relationship between the advantages and the devices more clear. I suggest you start the second paragraph with \"As a result\" to emphasize the cause and effect relationship between the use of tablets and increased student participation.\n\nNext, let's work on incorporating semicolons to clarify the information in the essay. A semicolon can be used to separate two independent clauses that are closely related and could be separate sentences. \n\nFor example, instead of saying \"In addition, we are in the post-covid era, students and professor can contact online via Zoom of Google Meets, and it can also increase participation of students in class who are far away,\" you can use a semicolon to connect the related ideas, like this: \"In addition, we are in the post-covid era; students and professors can contact each other online via Zoom or Google Meets, which can also increase participation of students who are far away.\" \n\nAnother way to use a semicolon would be in the sentence \"The most important part of the advantages, usefulness, is that students can do those things with only one electronic device; they need no paper, no pencil, no erasers.\" Here, the semicolon is used to emphasize the importance of the advantages of using electronic devices in the classroom and to clarify the information.\n\nAdditionally, let's make sure the verb tense is consistent throughout the essay. For example, in the second sentence of the first paragraph, you wrote \"has brought about,\" which is in present perfect tense. However, the following sentence uses present tense. Be consistent in your use of verb tense to ensure clarity and coherence.\n\nFinally, we can add some transition signals between the paragraphs to make the flow of information more smooth. For example, you could use phrases like \"Moreover\" or \"Furthermore\" to connect the two paragraphs.\n\nHere's a revision of your essay with these suggested improvements:\n\nIn recent years, the increased use of tablets, laptops, and other internet technology devices in classrooms has brought about two significant advantages: increased student participation and greater usefulness of these devices in the classroom. \n\nAs a result, the use of tablets and laptops can lead to increased student participation in class activities by providing engaging tools and incorporating online learning platforms. For example, playing Kahoot quiz about what students have learned increases understanding of the concept they have learned, and using QR codes to join some activity in class will rise interest of students.

        "response": "Great work on your initial essay! Let's see how we can make it even better by implementing a compare and contrast analysis.\n\nCompare and contrast essays usually involve identifying similarities and differences between two or more things. In the case of your essay, you could compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of using electronic devices (such as tablets and laptops) in the classroom. Here's how you could revise your essay with a compare and contrast analysis:\n\nIn recent years, the use of electronic devices in classrooms has become more prevalent, and there are both advantages and disadvantages to this trend. In terms of advantages, increased student participation and greater usefulness in the classroom are the most notable benefits.\n\nOn the one hand, the use of tablets and laptops can increase student participation in class activities by providing engaging tools and incorporating online learning platforms. For example, playing Kahoot or Quizlet games about the course material can enhance understanding and retention of key concepts. Similarly, online platforms like Zoom or Google Meets can provide an opportunity for students to engage with professors and peers even if they are not physically present in the classroom. By using tablets and laptops, students can participate in class more actively and experience a more immersive learning environment.\n\nOn the other hand, some critics argue that a reliance on electronic devices in the classroom can have negative consequences. For instance, it can foster a culture of distraction and undermine students' ability to focus. Moreover, technology can sometimes fail, leading to disruptions in teaching and learning. In addition, while electronic documents are convenient, they can be easily lost if not properly saved or backed up. \n\nDespite these potential disadvantages, the advantages of using electronic devices in the classroom outweigh the disadvantages. In particular, electronic devices enable greater collaboration, productivity, and flexibility among students and professors.\n\nBy taking advantage of these benefits, students can use their own tablet or laptop computers in class with more ease and productivity. \n\nOverall, your essay is well-written and provides a thoughtful analysis of electronic device usage in the classroom. By following the compare and contrast format, you were able to highlight both the advantages and disadvantages of electronic device usage and offer a more nuanced perspective.

In terms of advantages, increased student participation and greater usefulness in the classroom are the most notable benefits.\nOn the one hand, the use of tablets and laptops can increase student participation in class activities by providing engaging tools and incorporating online learning platforms. For example, playing Kahoot or Quizlet games about the course material can enhance understanding and retention of key concepts. Similarly, online platforms like Zoom or Google Meets can provide an opportunity for students to engage with professors and peers even if they are not physically present in the classroom. By using tablets and laptops, students can participate in class more actively and experience a more immersive learning environment.\nOn the other hand, some critics argue that a reliance on electronic devices in the classroom can have negative consequences. For instance, it can foster a culture of distraction and undermine students' ability to focus. Moreover, technology can sometimes fail, leading to disruptions in teaching and learning. In addition, while electronic documents are convenient, they can be easily lost if not properly saved or backed up.\nDespite these potential disadvantages, the advantages of using electronic devices in the classroom outweigh the disadvantages. In particular, electronic devices enable greater collaboration, productivity, and flexibility among students and professors.\nBy taking advantage of these benefits, students can use their own tablet or laptop computers in class with more ease and productivity.",

But very few of them including -IST universities like KAIST, let the first year students to be major-free. They choose their major in second year, or in the end of their first year. Even though there are many advantages and disadvantages with it, I think the first year students of college should be major-free.\n One of the most important benefit of first-year-major-free is that the freshmen can have chances to have contact with various fields of study. Some people may say major-free can make students stressed by forcing them to listen to unintersted subjects. But in the near future, we have to work on topics that are not only included to one field. We will need knowledges and perspectives of various fields, and the basic knowledge from the first year class will help overcoming it. Also, we can find unexpected interests. Learning about new fields of study may help them find their interests.\n Secondly, some other people say major-free is a waste of time for students who already decided their major, but it is not quite true. For example, despite my university is major-free in the first year, there are friends who listen to the classes for particular major. Some of them are accquiring organic, or biochemistry, and another friend is accquiring programming class for 3rd, or 4th years. Likewise, students with concrete dicision about their major can participate to such class, because it's major-'free'.\n Lastly, major-free can help first-year students meet diverse people. In most universities that require their first students to choose their major usually divides the dormitory or class by major. This prevents students to meet people from other major, who have different point of view. Major-free can make students team-up with students of other majors, and help them grow abilities to cooperate with people who think different from them.\n In conclusion, letting first-year students of college to be major-free can help them find new interests, freely listen to their intersted subjects, meet diverse people. For these reasons, I strongly believe making first-year students of universities will help the students and the society.",

But very few of them including -IST universities like KAIST, let the first year students to be major-free. They choose their major in second year, or in the end of their first year. Even though there are many advantages and disadvantages with it, I think the first year students of college should be major-free.\n One of the most important benefit of first-year-major-free is that the freshmen can have chances to have contact with various fields of study. Some people may say major-free can make students stressed by forcing them to listen to unintersted subjects. But in the near future, we have to work on topics that are not only included to one field. We will need knowledges and perspectives of various fields, and the basic knowledge from the first year class will help overcoming it. Also, we can find unexpected interests. Learning about new fields of study may help them find their interests.\n Secondly, some other people say major-free is a waste of time for students who already decided their major, but it is not quite true. For example, despite my university is major-free in the first year, there are friends who listen to the classes for particular major. Some of them are accquiring organic, or biochemistry, and another friend is accquiring programming class for 3rd, or 4th years. Likewise, students with concrete dicision about their major can participate to such class, because it's major-'free'.\n Lastly, major-free can help first-year students meet diverse people. In most universities that require their first students to choose their major usually divides the dormitory or class by major. This prevents students to meet people from other major, who have different point of view. Major-free can make students team-up with students of other majors, and help them grow abilities to cooperate with people who think different from them.\n In conclusion, letting first-year students of college to be major-free can help them find new interests, freely listen to their intersted subjects, meet diverse people. For these reasons, I strongly believe making first-year students of universities will help the students and the society.",

I can follow the lecture without any blank.\n\n    Third, Tablet Notetaking gives me many benefits.\n When I am notetaking at the paper, It is little bit hard to draw a flat line or circle or highlight the important part. But ata the tablet environment , I can easily do notetaking by a few click. I can choose the color of the pen or thickness of the pen and there are tools such as ruler, triangle , rectangule, circle\n If I want and accessed, I can record some part of lecture.

Using a tablet/laptop computer in class can take a lot of advantages for students.\n\nFirst, students don’t need to bring their heavy textbooks in class. If they bring their own tablet/laptop computers, they are able to view textbooks, write their notes, and refer provided readings with just one devices. It is much more convenient than bringing their heavy textbooks, notes, and extra papers.\n\nSecond, students can search terms or concepts that they can’t understand very quickly. With the Internet, an ocean of information, they can easily find the definition of some terms, or the meaning of abstract concepts. Using these devices enable students to deeply understand what their professor says.\n\nLastly, students can reward the lectures with their laptop/tablet computers. Although students write their notes to understand, and to remember the lecture, there is a limit with just writing some sentences. If students can record a video or an audio for lecture, students can supplement what they missed in class; therefore students can learn more about the topic they are dealing with.\n\nAs you can see, there are lots of advantages when students can use their tablet/laptop computers in class.",

First, you need to add a clear and specific topic sentence that indicates the main idea of your essay. Your thesis can be something like this: \"The use of tablet/laptop computers in the classroom provides many benefits for students.\"\n\n2. In your body paragraphs, you have described the advantages of using tablet/laptop computers in the classroom. However, you need to make sure that each body paragraph has a topic sentence that guides and supports the main idea of your essay. To help you with this, I have made some suggestions as follows:\n\n- First advantage: Students can have a more convenient way of studying as they don't need to bring their heavy textbooks with them in class.\n- Second advantage: With a tablet/laptop computer, students can search for information on the internet easily and quickly.\n- Third advantage: Using a tablet/laptop computer can help students supplement what they missed in class through the recording of video or audio.\n\n3. Lastly, you should end your essay with a concluding sentence that ties everything together. Your concluding sentence can be something like this: \"In conclusion, the use of tablet/laptop computers in the classroom is a practical and effective way to enhance the learning experience.\" \n\nI hope this revision helps you to improve your essay.

To make your introduction more interesting and to catch the reader's attention, you can try to start with a hook that relates to the topic of your essay. This can include a fact, a quote, or a personal anecdote that is relevant to your essay topic.\n\nFor example, let's say your essay is about the benefits of using a tablet/laptop in class, and your thesis is \"The use of tablet/laptop computers in the classroom provides many benefits for students\". You can start your introduction with a hook like this:\n\n- \"Did you know that more than 70% of college students use a tablet or laptop in class? In today's digital age, the use of technology has become an integral part of student life. However, the advantages go beyond just convenience.\"\n\nThis way, you can introduce the topic of your essay while also capturing and maintaining the reader's attention.

Start with a question: Asking a question is a great way to grab the reader's attention and make them curious about the rest of your essay. For example, \"How many college students use tablet/laptop computers in class each day? You may be surprised to learn that the majority of students prefer to use digital devices rather than traditional textbooks.\"\n\n2. Use a startling fact or statistic: Sharing a surprising or shocking piece of information can help to pique the reader's interest. For example, \"Did you know that research indicates students who use tablet/laptop computers in the classroom achieve higher grades than those who solely use traditional textbooks?\".\n\n3. Tell an anecdote or story: An engaging story or personal anecdote can help to create a connection with the reader and provide context for your essay. For example, \"As a student myself, I have experienced the struggle of carrying multiple heavy textbooks for each class. But when I switched to using a digital device, my academic life became much more manageable.\"\n\n4. Use a quote: A well-chosen quote from an expert, famous person, or even a student can help to spark interest in your topic. For example, \"As Steve Jobs once said, 'Technology is nothing. What's important is that you have a faith in people, that they're basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they'll do wonderful things with them.'\"\n\nRemember, the purpose of your hook is to draw the reader in and make them interested in your essay. You should choose one that is relevant to your topic and makes sense within the context of your essay.",

Using a tablet/laptop computer in class can take a lot of advantages for students.\n\nFirst, students don’t need to bring their heavy textbooks in class. If they bring their own tablet/laptop computers, they are able to view textbooks, write their notes, and refer provided readings with just one devices. It is much more convenient than bringing their heavy textbooks, notes, and extra papers.\n\nSecond, students can search terms or concepts that they can’t understand very quickly. With the Internet, an ocean of information, they can easily find the definition of some terms, or the meaning of abstract concepts. Using these devices enable students to deeply understand what their professor says.\n\nLastly, students can reward the lectures with their laptop/tablet computers. Although students write their notes to understand, and to remember the lecture, there is a limit with just writing some sentences. If students can record a video or an audio for lecture, students can supplement what they missed in class; therefore students can learn more about the topic they are dealing with.\n\nAs you can see, there are lots of advantages when students can use their tablet/laptop computers in class.",

First, you need to add a clear and specific topic sentence that indicates the main idea of your essay. Your thesis can be something like this: \"The use of tablet/laptop computers in the classroom provides many benefits for students.\"\n\n2. In your body paragraphs, you have described the advantages of using tablet/laptop computers in the classroom. However, you need to make sure that each body paragraph has a topic sentence that guides and supports the main idea of your essay. To help you with this, I have made some suggestions as follows:\n\n- First advantage: Students can have a more convenient way of studying as they don't need to bring their heavy textbooks with them in class.\n- Second advantage: With a tablet/laptop computer, students can search for information on the internet easily and quickly.\n- Third advantage: Using a tablet/laptop computer can help students supplement what they missed in class through the recording of video or audio.\n\n3. Lastly, you should end your essay with a concluding sentence that ties everything together. Your concluding sentence can be something like this: \"In conclusion, the use of tablet/laptop computers in the classroom is a practical and effective way to enhance the learning experience.\" \n\nI hope this revision helps you to improve your essay.

To make your introduction more interesting and to catch the reader's attention, you can try to start with a hook that relates to the topic of your essay.

You can start your introduction with a hook like this:\n\n- \"Did you know that more than 70% of college students use a tablet or laptop in class? In today's digital age, the use of technology has become an integral part of student life. However, the advantages go beyond just convenience.\"\n\nThis way, you can introduce the topic of your essay while also capturing and maintaining the reader's attention.

For example, \"How many college students use tablet/laptop computers in class each day? You may be surprised to learn that the majority of students prefer to use digital devices rather than traditional textbooks.\"\n\n2. Use a startling fact or statistic: Sharing a surprising or shocking piece of information can help to pique the reader's interest. For example, \"Did you know that research indicates students who use tablet/laptop computers in the classroom achieve higher grades than those who solely use traditional textbooks?\".\n\n3. Tell an anecdote or story: An engaging story or personal anecdote can help to create a connection with the reader and provide context for your essay. For example, \"As a student myself, I have experienced the struggle of carrying multiple heavy textbooks for each class. But when I switched to using a digital device, my academic life became much more manageable.\"\n\n4. Use a quote: A well-chosen quote from an expert, famous person, or even a student can help to spark interest in your topic. For example, \"As Steve Jobs once said, 'Technology is nothing. What's important is that you have a faith in people, that they're basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they'll do wonderful things with them.'\"\n\nRemember, the purpose of your hook is to draw the reader in and make them interested in your essay. You should choose one that is relevant to your topic and makes sense within the context of your essay.",

For example, the sentence \"for example in society class, teacher (or professor) teach some society situation\" could be rephrased to \"For example, in a sociology class, the teacher/professor may present a current social issue.\"\n- Some of the paragraphs seem too long and could be broken down into shorter paragraphs to make the essay more readable.\n\n3. Supporting Details:\n- While you make some good points about the benefits of using a laptop/tablet in class, it would be helpful to add more specific examples to support your argument.\n- For instance, you mention that using the internet can provide access to up-to-date information. Could you provide some specific examples of how this has benefited you in a class or a project?\n- Similarly, you suggest that using apps like Goodnote can help organize and summarize lectures.

Let's go through each paragraph and make some revisions.\n\nIn your introduction, you have provided a good overview of the topic. However, you can make it more engaging by adding a hook or a thesis statement. A hook can be a question, a quote, or a statistic that captures the reader's attention. A thesis statement is a sentence that summarizes the main point of your essay. It should be clear and concise. For example, you can start your introduction with a hook like this: \"Did you know that the Covid-19 pandemic has revolutionized the way we learn? With the rise of online classes, students are now using laptops and tablets more than ever before. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of using electronic devices for studying.\"\n\nIn your first body paragraph, you have discussed the mobility of laptops and tablets. You have made a good point that these devices are lighter than traditional textbooks and notes. However, you can expand on this idea by providing some examples or evidence. For instance, you can mention a study that shows how much weight students can save by using electronic devices instead of books. You can also explain how this mobility can benefit students in different situations, such as commuting or traveling.\n\nIn your second body paragraph, you have discussed the ability of laptops and tablets to increase students' studying skills. You have made a good point that these devices can record lectures and make note-taking easier. However, you can improve this paragraph by providing more details on how these features work. For example, you can explain how students can use apps like OneNote or Evernote to organize their notes and recordings. You can also mention some tips on how to use these tools effectively, such as using keywords or tags to categorize information.\n\nIn your third body paragraph, you have discussed the connectivity of laptops and tablets. You have made a good point that these devices can help students connect with their peers and teachers. However, you can improve this paragraph by providing more examples of how this connectivity works. For instance, you can mention some online platforms that students can use to collaborate, such as Google Drive or Zoom. You can also explain how teachers can use these platforms to provide feedback or answer questions from students.\n\nIn your conclusion, you have summarized your main points and provided a good closing statement. However, you can make it more impactful by adding a call to action or a final thought. A call to action is a sentence that encourages the reader to take action or think about the topic in a different way. For example, you can end your essay with a call to action like this: \"As we embrace the digital era of education, let us not forget the importance of human interaction and critical thinking. By using laptops and tablets wisely, we can enhance our learning experience and prepare ourselves for the challenges of the future.\"\n\nOverall, you have done a good job on your essay. By making these revisions, you can make your writing more engaging, informative, and persuasive. Keep up the good work!",

Also, there are a lot of concerns of using tablets and laptops, because they lower the concentration of students or they make student's eyes unhealthy. But I want to emphasize that despite of these problems, there are a lot of advantages of using tablets and laptops. There are 3 reasons.\n First of all, tablets and laptops permit students to save time. The functions of searching and recording could allow students to save their time. Specifically, searching function in the electronic devices allow us to fine the information, which we are not aware of or which are confused, quickly, Students just type the word that they want to know, and just for a moment, lots of useful information come out. When it comes to recording function, students could record the lecture. After that, they can play it 1.5 or twice time faster. So they can save their time using an efficient way.\n Second, using tablets and laptops, students can study more efficient. Let's get back to the recording functions. students can listen again the lecture. This means they can pick up what they didn't understand at that time when they are in the class, and they can study that part while they understand the information.\n Finally it will be helpful to space-efficiency. By using Zoom function, it is not necessary that all students have to come to class. If there is the class that too many students are existed, this will be more helpful.\n For these reasons, I want to emphasize using a tablet or laptop computer in class is good way for students.",

        "response": "Great job starting your essay with a clear introduction that introduces your topic and main point. One suggestion that I have for you is to include a thesis statement that specifically outlines the main points/principles that you will be exploring in your essay. Here's an example of a revised introduction with a clear thesis statement:\n\nIn today's digital age, tablets and laptops have become ubiquitous tools for students, including at KAIST. While concerns have been raised about the potential negative effects of these devices on student concentration and eye health, it is important to recognize the many benefits that they offer for academic success. This essay will explore three key advantages of using tablets and laptops in the classroom: time savings, increased learning efficiency, and improved space efficiency. \n\nNow let's take a closer look at your body paragraphs to review the unity and coherence of your essay. \n\nFirst of all, tablets and laptops permit students to save time. The functions of searching and recording could allow students to save their time. Specifically, searching function in the electronic devices allow us to fine the information, which we are not aware of or which are confused, quickly, Students just type the word that they want to know, and just for a moment, lots of useful information come out. When it comes to recording function, students could record the lecture. After that, they can play it 1.5 or twice time faster. So they can save their time using an efficient way.\n\nThis paragraph is well organized and the topic sentence is clear. The paragraph focuses on the time saving advantages of using tablets and laptops in the classroom. You provide two specific examples of how electronic devices can save time – through efficient search functions and recording capabilities, and both of these examples are related to the main point of the paragraph. \n\nSecond, using tablets and laptops, students can study more efficient. Let's get back to the recording functions. students can listen again the lecture. This means they can pick up what they didn't understand at that time during the class, and they can study that part while they understand the information.\n\nThis paragraph could benefit from more detail and specific examples to more fully support your idea of increased learning efficiency. Here's an example of how you could expand the paragraph with more detail:\n\nAnother key advantage of using tablets and laptops in the classroom is that they can make studying more efficient by allowing students to review lecture content at their own pace. For example, recording functions can help students pick up on information they may have missed during class or that did not make sense to them at the time. By listening to recordings multiple times and studying challenging material more closely, students are better able to grasp course concepts and improve their grades. \n\nFinally it will be helpful to space-efficiency. By using Zoom function of electronic devices, it is not necessary that all students have to come to class. If there is the class that too many students are existed, this will be more helpful.\n\nThis paragraph is a bit unclear and could benefit from a clearer explanation of your point about space efficiency. Here's an example of a revised paragraph with more detail:\n\nFinally, the use of tablets and laptops in the classroom can have a positive effect on space efficiency. With the advent of video conferencing technologies like Zoom, electronic devices can allow students to participate in classes and collaborate with their peers from anywhere. For instance, if a class is oversubscribed and too many students are present physically, electronic devices can be used to provide remote access and allow everyone to participate equally. Additionally, eBooks and online course materials can greatly reduce the physical space requirements for traditional textbooks and other teaching materials, resulting in more effective use of classroom resources.\n\nIn conclusion, your essay overall demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts of unity and coherence. By focusing on a clear thesis statement and ensuring that each paragraph has a main idea that supports the overall argument, you are on the right track toward constructing an effective and compelling essay.

        "response": " In today's digital age, tablets and laptops have become ubiquitous tools for students, and most of students in KAIST also use them to listen lectures and taking notes for important information. While concerns have been raised about the potential negative effects of these devices on student concentration and eye health, it is important to recognize the many benefits that they offer for academic success. This essay will explore three key advantages of using tablets and laptops in the classroom: time savings, increased learning efficiency, and improved space efficiency.\n First of all, tablets and laptops permit students to save time. The functions of searching and recording could allow students to save their time. Specifically, searching function in the electronic devices allow us to fine the information, which we are not aware of or which are confused, quickly, Students just type the word that they want to know, and just for a moment, lots of useful information come out. When it comes to recording function, students could record the lecture. After that, they can play it 1.5 or twice time faster. So they can save their time using an efficient way.\n Another key advantage of using tablets and laptops in the classroom is that they can make studying more efficient by allowing students to review lecture content at their own pace. For example, recording functions can help students pick up on information they may have missed during class or that did not make sense to them at the time. By listening to recordings multiple times and studying challenging material more closely, students are better able to grasp course concepts and improve their grades.\n Finally, the use of tablets and laptops in the classroom can have a positive effect on space efficiency. With the advent of video conferencing technologies like Zoom, electronic devices can allow students to participate in classes and collaborate with their peers from anywhere. For example, if a class is oversubscribed and too many students are present physically, electronic devices can be used to provide remote access and allow everyone to participate equally. Additionally, eBooks and online course materials can greatly reduce the physical space requirements for traditional textbooks and other teaching materials, resulting in more effective use of classroom resources.\n For these reasons, I want to emphasize using a tablet or laptop computer in class is good way for students.\n\nThis is my essay. Can you recommend what should be included in the conclusion of my essay?",

By allowing students to save time, increase learning efficiency, and improve space efficiency, these devices have become essential tools for modern-day learning. Therefore, I strongly recommend the use of tablets and laptops in the classroom as a way to enhance the learning experience and improve academic performance.",

However, it's important to note that there may be some downsides to using electronic devices as well, such as distractions from social media or other apps. It's important to use these devices in a responsible and focused manner to maximize their benefits.",

Although it is good to have a dream their own just because if their simple interest, their interest can be changed as they study more deeply that area. Moreover, there are also people who don’t have their own dream until high school. Thus, choosing major before the first year of college is harsh. Nextly, freshman level subjects such as calculus, general physics, and general chemistry are not related deeply with majors.

In Korea, the most hot standard for college is whether the location of college is Seoul or not. The fame also can be a standard and whether what major they have is not a consideration.

In major-free system, student choose the major. So the people in each major advertise passionally and research hard to make students' attention. After the students choose the major, they also work hard for next students and for themself to get much budget from the universities.\nTherefore, for the universities' future, the major-free system for the first-year is needed.

Here are some steps you can take to revise your essay:\n\n1. Introduction: Start with a clear and engaging hook that can grab the reader's attention. You can begin with a statistic or an interesting fact that highlights the importance of the topic. For example, \"In the 21st century, technology has transformed the way we learn, and tablets have become an essential tool in classrooms worldwide.\"\n\n2. Thesis statement: Provide a clear and concise thesis statement that captures the main point of your essay. The thesis statement should be presented in the introduction, preferably as the last sentence. For example, \"Tablets offer significant advantages over traditional textbooks such as access to the internet, portability, and efficient note-taking that can enhance learning outcomes for students.\"\n\n3. Topic sentences: Ensure that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence that supports your thesis statement. The topic sentence should introduce the main idea of the paragraph, and the subsequent sentences should provide evidence to support it. For example, \"The convenience of accessing the internet is one of the key advantages of using tablets in classrooms.\"\n\n4. Evidence: Provide specific examples, data or statistics, to support your claims. Be sure to cite your sources appropriately. For example, \"According to a recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 80% of students use tablets in college, and 60% cite the ability to access the internet as the most significant benefit.\"\n\n5. Conclusion: End your essay with a strong conclusion that summarizes the main points of your essay, reiterates your thesis statement and provides a final thought. For example, \"In conclusion, tablets offer numerous advantages over traditional textbooks that can improve the learning experience for students. While there may be some initial costs, the benefits far outweigh the costs, making tablets a worthwhile investment in education.\"\n\nGood luck!",

To avoid repeating yourself, you can remove the sentence \"Tablets offer significant advantages over traditional textbooks such as access to the internet, portability, and efficient note-taking that can enhance learning outcomes for students\" in the second paragraph since you have already mentioned it in the thesis statement.\n\n3. When discussing the advantage of accessing the internet, you may want to provide an example of how it can help students in their studies. For instance, you can mention that students can watch educational videos or conduct research quickly and easily.\n\n4. You can consider adding additional evidence to support your ideas. For example, for the weight advantage, you can include a quote from a student who has experienced the benefits of using a tablet instead of carrying heavy textbooks.\n\n5.

You can also encourage readers to consider the benefits of digital learning.\n\nOverall, you have a well-organized essay with clear advantages of using tablets in school. Good job!",

Your sentences are a bit choppy and could use better flow. Instead of saying \"nowadays\" to start the first sentence, try something like, \"In today's classrooms, many students use laptops or tablets...\" Also, the sentence \"Someone stay at the transition porision and use paper note and textbook\" is unclear. Who is \"someone?\" Instead, you could say something like, \"However, some students still opt for traditional paper notes and textbooks.\" \n\nNow let's move on to the body paragraphs. Great job including a topic sentence for each paragraph! However, there are some grammar errors and run-on sentences. For example, in the first paragraph, you could say, \"We can easily find a wealth of information on the Internet. Many university courses use complex terminology, but a quick search can help us understand.\" Try to break up long sentences into shorter, more concise ones. \n\nIn the second paragraph, there is a typo (\"illigal\" instead of \"illegal\") and a run-on sentence. You could say something like, \"It may be illegal, but with a tablet, students can download all of their textbooks in the form of PDFs. Traditional textbooks can be heavy, with just a couple weighing up to 5kg. However, a tablet can hold thousands of PDFs without adding significant weight.\" \n\nLastly, in the third paragraph, there is another run-on sentence. You could revise it to say something like, \"One major advantage of tablets is the availability of note-taking applications. These apps can help students take notes more efficiently than traditional paper methods, and can include helpful features for studying.\" \n\nOverall, great job including specific, detailed advantages of using a tablet in the classroom. Keep in mind that sentences should be concise and easy to read. I hope these revisions are helpful for you!",

        "response": "Great, you have shown a good understanding of the use of commas in lists. Let us now work on revising your essay, keeping in mind the rules for comma usage in lists.\n\nFirstly, let's fix the opening sentence of your essay. You should add a comma after Nowadays to separate it from the rest of the sentence. Also, you mentioned the word \"lap top\"; however, it should be written as \"laptop.\"\n\nCorrected sentence: Nowadays, most of the students use a laptop or a tablet in class.\n\nNow, let's focus on the body paragraphs of your essay. You mentioned that you will write about three representative advantages of using a tablet. Therefore, we should use commas to separate these three ideas in the opening paragraph. \n\nHere's a revised version of your paragraph:\n\nThe first advantage is the internet. We can find a huge amount of information on the internet. For example, in university classes, there are some complicated words that are hard to understand. We can look up these words by using just one search on the internet. On the other hand, the internet can show us the most recent research related to the class, which makes it easier for students to learn.\n\nThe next advantage is weight. It might be illegal, but students can take all of their textbooks in the form of PDFs on a tablet. University textbooks can be heavy, and carrying just two or three books can easily weigh 5kg. However, even if you download thousands of PDFs, the weight of the tablet doesn't change; it remains at just 0.001kg.\n\nThe last advantage is note-taking. There are many high-quality note-taking applications available. Compared to paper notes, it takes significantly less time. Also, the many functions in these applications help you make good notes for studying.\n\nTo sum up, the internet, weight, and note-taking are three big advantages of using a tablet for studying. There are also many other benefits to using a tablet that could be mentioned. So, why not invest in a nice tablet today?\n\nOverall, the essay is well-written, and you've done a great job in explaining the advantages of using a tablet. Keep in mind that commas are one of the most important punctuation marks, so pay close attention to their usage in your writing.",

These days in Korea, lots of smart students who are in high scored universities like Seoul, Yonsei, or Kaist, leave their schools. It could be due to universities’ system that they should choose their major before they enter to universities. Instead of this, there are lots of problems in choosing major early. Thus, universities should be required to major-free in first year of college.\nAt first, in high school, it is hard to choose the major. In universities, there are many major and classes. However, in high school, every students learn just few subjects like chemistry and physics. Also, they cannot get the information of major easily. Thus, there are less information of major, so students cannot choose major well. Un addition they do not have much time to think about major. Korea’s national exam ‘수능’ is very hard and it is hard to get good grade. Due to this, high school students have to study very hard than others. Thus, they do not have time to search their dream or major. In conclusion, high school students do not have sufficient information and time to choose major, so first grade of college should be major free. \nSecond, the major-free year could be provide diverse experience to students. When we choose the major, we have to choose the course related to our major, so undergraduate student’s background information could be limited. Especially, these days, the collaboration of diverse major is important. It could be help people to be more creative and think diverse way. Thus, for more experiences, the first year in college should be major free.\nAt next, the major-free policy could help the Korea’s education system changing. The past and current education system is not helpful to students’ future. For example, in high school students study hard for ‘수능’. But when they finished the exam, they forgot lots of things and did not study them again. Thus, the three years of students in high school is not that efficiency. On the other hand, some students who want to be a biologist of chemist, study the Earth science or East Asian history, because these subjects are easy to them. It is not good education. When, every college change the first year to major-free, students do not have to study for get the good major. In addition, students choose the major that are highest they can get with their grade. For example, in our school, student who want to be biologist go to mechanic school, and student who want to be a physicist go to medical school. Like this, most of students in Korea, they cannot study what they want tin college. So, the first year in college should be major-free. \nIn conclusion, when the first year of college become major-free, it can help high school students who are hard to choose the major due to less information and time, undergraduate students to get many experiences, and education system in Korea. There are lots of benefit than disadvantages, so first year of college should be major-free.",

In the second paragraph, you need a comma after \"thus\" in the sentence \"Thus, they do not have time to search their dream or major.\"\n\n3.

Let's focus on how you can apply these concepts to your own essay. \n\nFirst, let's start by identifying any cases of discontinuity in your writing. Discontinuity refers to when there are sudden or abrupt shifts or changes in your writing that interrupt the flow of your ideas. Can you identify any instances of this in your essay? If so, let's work on smoothing out those transitions, whether it's through the use of transitional phrases, more logical ordering of your ideas, or other strategies.\n\nNext, let's discuss cluttered or complex typography. This can refer to when there is an overly complicated or cluttered arrangement of text on the page. It can also refer to when there are too many different fonts, sizes, or colors being used, which can be distracting and make your writing harder to read. Take a look at your essay and see if there are any areas where simplification could be helpful. Consider whether there are any unnecessary formatting elements that could be removed or if the layout could be adjusted to make it more readable.\n\nAs you revise, keep in mind that simplification and clarity should be your guiding principles.

Both sides may have their own reasons to support their view. If I had to choose one, I would say that school uniforms should not be required for high school students. There are several reasons as follow. First reason is school uniforms are uncomfortable to wear. We need to wear skinny pants and shirt. Also we need to wear neet and necktie on the shirt. so It is very hard to wear and move to other places. And number of sizes are not enough to wear for high school students. For example, some fat students in high school feel very uncomfortable that there are not size that they wear comfortable. Second reason is students can't wear clothes they want. Clothes can represent ourselves to other people. So High school students want to wear clothes that represent themselves. For example some students wear clothes that characters on it to represent they like this chracter. And students can wear clothes as situations in school. For instance, some students like to play soccer in break time. Then they can wear comfortable clothes to play soccer easier. Third reason is students can't wear clothes freely as wheather changes. There are somedays that students feel Cold when wear school uniforms. If school uniforms should be required for high school students, they can't change their clothes warmer. Then students can get diesease or cold. Also students feel temperature differently in same weather. In this case school uniforms can't fit personly at most of days. So we have to make Student can choose their own clothes to adapt in weather. In Conclusion, I think school uniforms should not be reguired in high students.

Remember to capitalize the first letter of the first word in each sentence, proper nouns (names of people, places, or things), titles, and the first word after a colon.\n\nOn to the essay, I see some capitalization errors in the following sentences:\n\n- \"Both sides may have their own reasons to support their view.\"\n- \"First reason is school uniforms are uncomfortable to wear.\"\n- \"Also we need to wear neet and necktie on the shirt.\"\n- \"Second reason is students can't wear clothes they want.\"\n- \"So High school students want to wear clothes that represent themselves.\"\n- \"Third reason is students can't wear clothes freely as wheather changes.\"\n- \"In Conclusion, I think school uniforms should not be reguired in high students.\"\n\nNext, let's review your grammar. Here are some suggestions to revise your essay:\n\n- In the first sentence, you can rephrase it as \"Some people believe that high school students should be required to wear school uniforms while others disagree.\"\n- When you provide your reasons in the following paragraphs, you can start with \"The first reason\" instead of \"First reason.\"\n- In the sentence \"Also, we need to wear neat and necktie on the shirt,\" you can add \"a\" before \"neat\" to make it \"a neat\" and use the word \"a\" before \"necktie\" as well so that it becomes \"a necktie.\"\n- In the sentence \"So high school students want to wear clothes that represent themselves,\" you can omit the word \"so\" or start with \"Therefore.\"\n- In the sentence \"In conclusion, I think school uniforms should not be required for high school students,\" capitalization errors occur in two words - \"conclusion\" and \"required.\" You can make them both capitalized as \"In Conclusion, I think school uniforms should not be Reguired for high school students.\"\n\nOverall, your essay has several capitalization and grammar errors. Remember, when you write an essay, you must use proper capitalization, spelling, and grammar. I hope this was helpful for you, and I encourage you to revise your essay following the suggestions I have given you.",

Universities should require the first year of college to be major-free. I have three supporting reason that no major on the first year of college is beneficial in different reasons. \nFirst, an year without major gives students more freedom to choose, and it enables them to live a more non-passive life. Students can select what their lives and their first year on college would be like. Computer science student from the year would not try to find what they are truly interested in but passively accept the fate that leaning computer science is the fixed future they'll take. On the other hand freshmen with no major will consider carefully what they can choose and design their future on their own. The process is likely to be painstaking, however actively choosing the path of life will help students build their identity and passion to motivate themselves. Same student will choose challenging scheduals attending lots of classes. Others can attend diverse major class.\nSecondly, major-free freshmen can create networks with diverse peope. Integration between fields is what makes a breakthrough in not only academic areas but also arts and buissiness. Major-less freshmen will easily make bonds with people with diverse interests and history. Students with major would also make bonds, but not as easily and strong as students without major would. \nLastly, it's hard to get interested in one major until highschool graduation. Lacking life experience, highschool students often choose majors by first look or without knowing what the major is actually about. Universities in South Korea grade highschool students by their 'major compatable rate' that make highschool student lie  on their interests on the school records.

It can be revised like this: \"For this reason, universities should require the first year of college to be major-free.\" \n\nIn your fourth paragraph, the first sentence is a run-on sentence.

First, a year without a major gives students more freedom to choose, enabling them to live a less passive life.\" \n\nThe remaining sentences in the same paragraph contain errors of word choice, subject-verb agreement, and unclear pronoun reference.

In contrast, freshmen without a specific major can make informed and thoughtful decisions about their future.

[Note: This is the first supporting reason, which argues that not having a major creates more choices.] Students can select what their lives and their first year on college would be like. [Note: The author is emphasizing the freedom that lack of a major enables.] Computer science student from the year would not try to find what they are truly interested in but passively accept the fate that leaning computer science is the fixed future they'll take. [Note: The author is drawing attention to the limitations of declaring a major too early.] On the other hand freshmen with no major will consider carefully what they can choose and design their future on their own. [Note: The author is highlighting the proactive nature of choosing a path without a major.] The process is likely to be painstaking, however actively choosing the path of life will help students build their identity and passion to motivate themselves. [Note: The author is arguing that this proactive approach will benefit students in the long run.] Same student will choose challenging schedules attending lots of classes. Others can attend diverse classes in various majors. [Note: The author presents examples of the kinds of choices students can make without a major.]\n\nSecondly, major-free freshmen can create networks with diverse people. [Note: This is the second supporting reason, which argues that lack of a major enables broader social networks.] Integration between fields is what makes a breakthrough in not only academic areas but also arts and business. [Note: The author is arguing that integration between fields leads to important progress.] Major-free freshmen will easily make bonds with people with diverse interests and history. [Note: The author suggests that lack of a major makes it easier to connect with a broad range of people.] Students with major would also make bonds, but not as easily and strong as students without a major would. [Note: The author is contrasting students with majors and those without, arguing that the latter group has an advantage in terms of networking.]\n\nLastly, it's hard to become interested in one major until high school graduation. [Note: This is the third supporting reason, which argues that high school students may not have experience to make informed choices about majors.] Lacking life experience, high school students often choose majors by first look or without knowing what the major is actually about. [Note: The author is suggesting that high school students may make poor choices because of a lack of experience.] Universities in South Korea grade high school students by their 'major compatible rate' that cause high school student lie on their interests on the school records. [Note: The author is discussing a policy in South Korea that may lead students to lie about their interests.] First year without major will reduce this tendency and for the students who were not truly interested in the major they applied for a second chance.

In my opinion, this trend is beneficial to the students and other universities should require the first year of college to be major-free. I have three supporting reason that no major on the first year of college is beneficial in different reasons. \n\nFirst, a year without major gives students more freedom to choose, and it enables them to live a more active life. Students can select what their lives and their first year on college would be like. For example, computer science student from the first year would not try to find what they are truly interested in but passively accept that leaning computer science is the only coarse they'll take. On the other hand, freshmen with no major will consider carefully what they can choose and design their future on their own. *The process is likely to be painstaking, however actively choosing the path of life will help students build their identity and passion to motivate themselves. \n\nAnother reason why major-free freshmen is beneficial is that they can create networks with more diverse people. Integration between fields is what makes a breakthrough in not only academic areas but also arts and businesses. Major-free freshmen will easily make bonds with people with diverse interests, abilities and histories.  Students with major would also make bonds, but not as easily and strong, and not as diverse as students without a major would. \n\nLastly, it's hard to become interested in one major until high school graduation. Lacking life experience, high school students often choose majors by first look or without knowing what the major is actually about. Universities in South Korea grade high school students by their 'major compatible rate' that cause high school student lie  on their interests on the school records. First year without major will reduce this tendency and for the students who were not truly interested in the major they applied for a second chance.\n\nIn conclusion, more universities and colleges should give their first year students the chance to search for their major. No major on first year gives chance to plan life on students' own, encourages diverse social web creation, and makes students rethink the hastily chosen path of major they chose in high school. \"",

Some says the government should help and support all of its citizens regardless of their socioeconomic background insisting the fairness. But I think the government should help those most in need to achieve the goal of real fairness for several reasons. \n First of all , helping those in need is the way to accomplish the practical fairness. If the government supplies financial supports to all the citizen including rich people , is it a right way to achieve the true meaning of fairness? Such help would be meaningless and even increase the gap between rich and poor people which can cause a severe social problem. To make more citizens happier, the government productive should help people in need.\n In addition to the problem of practical fairness , helping all people is not efficient. It is well known that the happiness increases when the income rises up to certain extent, but after some level , happiness has little to do with the income level . Since the budget of the government for welfare is confined , we should use it efficiently. The amount of support that each individual receives becomes far less if the government helps all the people. However, by giving support to people, it would be more effective to increase the overall happiness of the country and make the country more productive.\n In conclusion, the government should prioritize helping those in need to achieve practical fairness, increase overall happiness, and promote productivity in society.",

Instead of saying \"There have been a lot of controversies on the social security system and governmental welfare,\" try starting with a more attention-grabbing statement or anecdote related to the topic. This will engage the reader right from the start.\n\nNext, let's take a look at your thesis statement. While you do state your stance on the issue, \"I think the government should help those most in need,\" it is not clear and concise enough. Try rephrasing it to: \"The government should prioritize assisting individuals with the greatest need to ensure practical fairness, increased overall happiness, and a more productive society,\" to make your stance clearer and more compelling.\n\nMoving on to your body paragraphs, it is helpful to use topic sentences that clearly introduce the main idea of each paragraph. For example, in the first paragraph, you could write, \"Providing financial support to all citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic background, is not an effective means of achieving true fairness and can exacerbate wealth disparities. Therefore, the government should prioritize assistance for those with the greatest need.\" This makes the topic of the paragraph clear and helps the reader follow your argument.\n\nAdditionally, instead of just stating your opinion, try to provide evidence and examples that support your ideas. This will make your argument more convincing. For example, you could cite studies or statistics that show how providing support to those in need boosts overall happiness and productivity. \n\nFinally, be sure to conclude your essay with a strong overall statement that summarizes your argument and leaves the reader with something to think about. Reiterate your stance and the reasons why you believe it's the best approach.\n\nI hope these suggestions help with your essay revision. Don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions or need further guidance!",

System model\nThe Joint Optimization for Intelligent Drone Edge Computing (JOIDEC) algorithm is a cutting-edge system designed to balance top-notch performance and data confidentiality. The system model is composed of three primary components: a resource and energy model, a latency model, and confidentiality.\n\n2.1 Service model\nWithin the service model, the YOLOv4-tiny deep learning model is employed for vision applications. This model is loaded into the memory of both the drone, which is outfitted with an Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU, and the MEC server. The system functions within a time slot environment, generating an a(t) frame of w (bits) size for inference during each time slot t. The mobile terminal ascertains the data volume to be processed, b(t), which varies from 0 to a(t). The model is split into Nm layer groups, with each frame being processed through all layer groups for inference. The drone and MEC server divide the processing operation according to the split point i(t) within each time period t, sharing the inference operation.\n\n2.2 Resource and energy consumption model\nThe resource and energy model fine-tunes the GPU clock frequency s(t) of the mobile terminal, specifically the Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU, for every time slot. The drone wirelessly sends data to the MEC server via the uplink network, and the amount of data transmittable in each time slot is defined as d(t) (bits).\n\n2.3 Latency and confidentiality model\nThe latency model is composed of four elements that determine the processing delay for a single frame: processing time on the drone, time required to send intermediate results to the MEC server, processing time at the MEC server, and time to download the final results for the drone. To guarantee confidentiality, data masking techniques are implemented to conceal sensitive data in intermediate results, making it challenging for an attacker to deduce sensitive information.\n\nThe methodology aims to reduce the volume of sensitive data transmitted to the MEC server by customizing the DNN model split between the drone and the server, based on the computing and memory requirements, as well as data dependencies of each layer group. By integrating the YOLOv4-tiny deep learning model and the Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU, the JOIDEC algorithm can efficiently carry out real-time object detection tasks while preserving data privacy and security.\n",

The goal is to minimize the amount of sensitive data transmitted to the MEC server by optimizing the split between the drone and the server. By integrating the YOLOv4-tiny deep learning model and the Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU, the JOIDEC algorithm can efficiently carry out real-time object detection tasks while preserving data privacy and security.\n\nI hope this revised draft helps to clarify the methodology and address your concerns.

Experiment Results\n4.1 Algorithm Performance Evaluation\nIn this study, a Joint-Optimization approach for QoE and confidentiality in Intelligent Drone Edge Computing (JOIDEC) algorithm has been proposed.

And a semicolon can join two independent clauses and separate items in a complex list.\nThird, there are several rules of using hyphens. Especially, when there is a compound modifier ending in -ly or to stack modifiers too much, we should not use hyphen.\nFinally, anticipatory reference and ambiguous antecendent are the common mistakes to unclear pronoun reference.

        "response": "The draft:\n\nThe samples for conductivity analysis were prepared in three different configurations. InOx layers were formed on SiO2 or Al2O3 buffer layers, as shown in Figure 1. Thermal oxidized Si wafers were used as substrates to ensure insulation between the InOx layer and Si wafer during conductivity measurements. As a reference sample, a 20 nm-thick InOx film was deposited on the substrate by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) at 200 °C with 100 W plasma power. It involved gaseous oxygen and 3-(Dimethylamino)proprylindium (DADI) precursor. Conductivity measurement electrodes were formed with 150 nm-thick molybdenum (Mo) by sputtering using shadow masks. (Figure 1(a)). The second sample was fabricated by sequential formation of SiO2 buffer layer and InOx. The SiO2 films were 500 nm-thick, and deposited via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) in an ambient gas mixture of SiH4/N2O at 300 °C. To recreate the fabrication process of TFTs, CF4 dry etch and photoresist (PR) strip were done on the SiO2 films. InOx layers and Mo electrode were formed using the same method as the reference sample (Figure 1.(b)). Fabrication of the third sample was same with the second sample, except for the formation of buffer layers. Instead of SiO2 films, 50 nm-thick Al2O3 films were deposited using thermal ALD at 150 °C with trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H2O precursor (Figure 1(c)). For surface depth profile analysis, the Mo electrode formation steps were excluded from the sample preparation. Vacuum thermal annealing was done before the electrode formation at temperatures at 100/200/300/400 °C, respectively. Four probe conductivity measurements were done on the samples with Mo electrode. Time-of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and elastic recoil detection (ERD) were used to measure the hydrogen concentration and depth profiles of elements in the films. Thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) was used to measure the amount of hydrogen desorbed from the surface as temperature increases.",

        "response": "Figure 2(a)-(d) compares the hydrogen content ([H]) depth profiles obtained by ToF-SIMS in InOx film deposited on top of thermally oxidized Si wafer, SiO2 buffer layer, and Al2O3 buffer layer. The samples were analyzed in as-deposited state, and after 280 °C vacuum annealing for 2 hours. The InOx film on thermal oxide was used as a reference, and was not annealed. Both samples irrespective of annealing showed higher [H]  in the buffer layer region, and it was higher in Al2O3 than SiO2.\nIn the as-deposited state, the [H] of InOx film was the highest on Al2O3 buffer, which can be attributed to the highest [H] in the Al2O3. The [H] of InOx film was the lowest in the sample with SiO2 buffer, which had the second highest [H]. The hydrogen might be absorbed into the SiO2 layer during deposition.\nAfter annealing, [H] in InOx films decreased. The decrease is most prominent in the sample with Al2O3 buffer, and it became lower than the sample with SiO2. The decrease in both samples can be explained by out-diffusion of hydrogen from the films into the vacuum, and the hydrogen in InOx on Al2O3 buffer might be more unstable than those on SiO2 buffer, causing the drastic decrease in [H] after annealing.\nThe depth profiles also showed humps at the interface. Since the shapes and locations of the humps differ by the buffer layer composition, the origin is likely be related to the interface properties. Detailed cause of these humps should be investigated further.\nTo investigate the change in [H] during annealing, the samples with SiO2 and Al2O3 buffer layers were annealed in vacuum at temperatures 100-400 °C for 2 hours. Figure 3(a)-(d) shows the [H] depth profile in SiO2 and Al2O3 buffer layers and the InOx film in the as-deposited state and after annealing. As shown in Figure 3(b), the InOx layer on SiO2 buffer had decreasing [H] as the annealing temperature increased. Since it also showed decreasing trend in the SiO2 buffer layer, it is most likely that the rate of hydrogen out-diffusion into the vacuum was higher than the diffusion from SiO2 to InOx.\n\tOn the other hand, [H] in InOx film on Al2O3 layer did not show a clear trend. As in Figure 3(d), [H] of as-deposited InOx film was the highest, and while the content was similar in annealing temperatures between 100-300 °C, the 400 °C annealed sample showed increasing [H] as the depth decreased. Interestingly, the [H] in the Al2O3 buffer region was the highest in 300 °C annealed sample, even higher than that of as-deposited. The reproducibility of the results needs to be confirmed, and the reasons behind the lack of a clear trend should be examined in detail.\n",

The InOx film was deposited using PEALD on top of thermal oxidized Si wafer, PECVD SiO2, and ALD Al2O3. Electrodes were fabricated on InOx for conductivity measurements. SIMS analysis revealed that vacuum annealing caused the out-diffusion of H in both buffer layers and InOx. For InOx films with SiO2 buffer layers, out-diffusion from both the InOx film and buffer layer was more severe at higher annealing temperatures. However, the out-diffusion trend was not clear in samples with Al2O3 buffer layers. There was no clear correlation for conductivity of InOx films and H concentration.

Designers can freely add, resize, move, and delete references for their design projects on the system. Users can also group references based on their specific goals. Then, the system provides three key features: (1) feature extraction, (2) feature integration, and (3) visualization.\nThe first feature is feature extraction, where the system extracts design-related features from the references. The system can extract layout, semantic objects, color schemes, and typography. To extract the layout and semantic objects from the reference, we used semantic segmentation model called IBM MAX-Object-Detector. Based on the segmented result, we trained Transformer-based model to get the hierarchical relationship between the objects and detect the layout. Python module called extcolors was used to extract the color scheme from the image, and font recognition open source code called DeepFont is used for font style extraction. These extracted features are then merged based on the reference group and displayed on the interface. When the user clicks on a specific reference, the extracted features for that image are displayed. Additionally, for groups of references, the system displays the common features shared by the images in the same group, enabling users to quickly identify the commonality of the group. CreativeConnect includes a search function that allows users to select specific design keywords or concepts and highlight reference images on the board based on those keywords. This function enables users to quickly discover new groups of references that they may not have considered before, expanding their ideation possibilities.\nCreativeConnect provides feature integration, a unique feature to support designers in their ideation process. The system suggests novel and valuable connections between different design features extracted from references. Using collaborative filtering technique, the system suggests connections between different design features that are extracted from various references. The model selects the best connections based on the user's preference for the level of serendipity. Higher levels of serendipity lead to more recommendations of connections between unrelated features, and vice versa. Designers can choose to accept or reject the suggestions, and the system will continue to learn and refine its recommendations based on the user's feedback. This feature enables users to break free from their usual patterns and discover new possibilities for their designs.\nThe visualization feature in CreativeConnect allows designers to test and visualize the connections they select from the previous step, feature integration. Users can choose the design features they want to combine and view a real-time visual representation of the proposed combination. The system generates a new reference image that displays the merged features using DallE-2, the text2image generative models, and this can be added to the board as a new reference. This helps users to evaluate how the different features interact and determine whether the proposed design aligns with their vision. This visualization feature supports an iterative design process by enabling users to quickly test and refine their ideas until they achieve the desired outcome.",

To extract the layout and semantic objects from the reference, we used a semantic segmentation model, the IBM MAX-Object-Detector.

This helps users to evaluate how the different features interact and determine whether the proposed design aligns with their vision. This visualization feature supports an iterative design process by enabling users to quickly test and refine their ideas until they achieve the desired outcome.\n\nAs for repetitive information, you mention \"expanding their ideation possibilities\" at the end of Paragraph 4 and then again in the first sentence of Paragraph 5. One possible way to avoid repetition would be to combine the two sentences into one, for example: \"CreativeConnect includes a search function that allows users to discover new groups of references and expand their ideation possibilities.

        "response": "By analyzing participants’ think-aloud scripts, we found out that all participants had three primary goals for their ideation: relevant design, aesthetically pleasing design, and novel design. They aimed to create a design that aligned well with the given topic, looked visually appealing, and stood out from existing designs. Based on these three goals, we analyzed how participants accomplish these goals using visual references in three separate ideation stages, which are reference search, idea generation, and narrowing down.\nDuring the reference search stage, we observed various strategies to stimulate novelty and creativity. Two of the six participants intentionally used general search terms to discover diverse results instead of topic-specific keywords. A different participant obtained references from a field unrelated to brand design, specifically interior design. Three participants used generative models in the hopes that the randomness of AI would lead to new ideas. As visual styles are difficult to explain in words, three out of six participants used recommendation functions for styles instead of formulate them as search keywords. They discovered one of the random images with a style they liked, and then proceeded with the further exploration by getting recommended images similar to the original image. After searching for references, all participants categorized them using their own criteria. These criteria were frequently divided into two categories: style-related keywords and topic-related keywords.\nIn the idea generation stage, participants employed two primary strategies. The first is to extract the commonness from multiple references. Five participants grouped the topic-related references and discover effective ways to convey topics by extracting common objects. For example, P3 said, “Looking at various references related to travel, I discovered that travel hats appeared frequently, and I decided to use this.” Three participants discovered the specific design elements (e.g., font, color) from the group of references that they liked, and decided to use this for their own design as well. However, this commonness sometimes affects their design in an opposite way. Two of the participants said that they aimed to identify and avoid design styles that were too common. The second strategy was to merge multiple references. Participants divided the topic into keywords, found references for each of them, and merged them together. They changed particular elements from a favorite reference to another element that can highlight the topic more effectively. They also combined references for different design elements, such as typography and color, and applied design elements from other references to a favorite reference.\nAfter generating a range of design concepts, the participants utilized visual references to build prototypes quickly and narrow their choices down. We observed that four participants utilized their references to validate their design concepts by confirming if several references complemented each other and if the design would appear visually appealing after developing this design concept. Additionally, two participants mentioned utilizing references to compare diverse design concepts by taking distinct design elements and implementing them interchangeably.\nBased on the interview after the ideation task, we identified various needs when utilizing references in design ideation. In terms of reference search, designers expressed a desire for a search function based on reference groups, rather than recommendations from single references. They also sought a tool to provide references for non-existent or abstract concepts, in addition to a recommendation system for specific design elements, like font, layout, and color. During the idea generation phases, designers desired a tool to automatically extract common design elements from their reference groups, as well as to modify specific parts of references to create new design variations. However, during the narrowing-down phase, we observed a lack of systems to support this aspect of the ideation process. These observations suggest an opportunity for developing computational tools to aid designers in the different stages of ideation.\nIn summary, this formative study aimed to investigate the strategies employed by designers when using different references together to generate creative ideas. The study found that designers tend to group multiple references according to their own criteria and utilize them as a collective source of inspiration rather than relying on a single reference. During the ideation process, designers extract common elements from their reference groups to guide their design direction, or merge multiple references to create new and creative design ideas. References are used as both a source of direction and stimulus for generating divergent ideas and as a material for making design decisions during the convergent phase. The study also revealed a need for a reference search tool that can provide references for non-existent or abstract concepts, as well as a recommendation system that can provide granular suggestions for different design elements. Finally, it was found that designers currently utilize generative models as reference providers.",

The result showed that iStooge could be beneficial for both fooling instructors to get the attendance credit and get better average grades compared to the previous research. In this discussion section, we’ll elaborate more on the potential, limitations, and future improvements of iStooge.\n\nFindings\nWe conducted an experiment to measure the relationship between this robot and actual grades. Table 1 shows the relative effectiveness of robot surrogate in varying conditions. The results of iStooge were generally better than the other two robots. Especially in math lectures, the efficiency is 100% in every robot. And in Table 2, we can see that the average grade is not too bad either.\nHowever, we can find performance differences between subjects. It shows that the performance of the English lecture is much worse than the Engineering lecture and the Math lecture. The reason for this is that the robot’s training data was significantly less for English than for Math and Engineering. Another reason may be that English lecture requires students more subjective and creative answers rather than a uniform correct answer, so it requires more advanced natural language processing techniques than Math and Engineering.\n\nLimitation\nOur work has several limitations which could be addressed in future works. First, iStooge has a limited set of error recovery methods. Currently, iStooge plays a pre-recorded apology to the instructor when it gives an incorrect answer. However, this approach may not seem natural to them as students do not typically apologize for incorrect answers during these classes. Therefore, this approach might be less effective. Instead of an apology, iStooge could use an embarrassing facial expression or an awkward laugh as an alternative method to recover from errors.\nAnother critical limitation is that no matter how much the effectiveness of the robots improves, it doesn't give students better grades than when they attend the class without robots. Therefore in future research, a novel robot function that allows students to get better grades than they attend the class themselves should be proposed. For example, since robots are good at memorizing things in the short-term better than humans, we can use this ability to help students score better on quizzes and other assessments.\n\nConclusion\nAttending class to get good grades is a significant problem for busy students. And the effect of low attendance on student grades has a negative aspect on the social life and work obligations of the student. So we proposed iStooge, a robot classroom attendance device that helps students efficiently do their school work by spending less time attending class and focusing more on extracurricular activities. It can attend class and answer the instructor’s questions, finally, it can fake student’s attendance. Then we conducted lab study using iStooge. The results showed that we are able to fool the instructor with fairly high performance and get a good grade, providing that it is possible to get a good grade without sufficient attendance. \n\n\n\n\nHere you go",

The difference between \"could lead\" and \"led\" is in verb tense. \"Could lead\" is in the conditional tense, indicating something that may happen in the future.

Without seeing your entire introduction draft, it's difficult to determine which option is more appropriate for your essay. However, if you are describing something that has already happened or a fact that is already known, \"led\" would likely be the better choice. If you're talking about a possibility or something that could happen in the future, then \"could lead\" might be more appropriate. Does that make sense?",

It can also refer to the act of resisting or holding back from doing something that may be required or expected. Reluctance usually implies some emotional or psychological barrier, such as fear, doubt, or anxiety, that prevents a person from taking action or making a commitment. It can be caused by various factors, including lack of information, insecurity, past experiences, or conflicting priorities. In general, reluctance suggests that a person needs more time, information, or reassurance before they can make a decision or take action.",

It should be long enough to present the data in a clear and concise manner, but not so long that it becomes tedious to read. Results section could be typically between 500-1500 words.\n\nThe discussion section, on the other hand, is usually longer than the results section. It affords you the opportunity to interpret your results, compare them with what's already known in the literature, and explore their implications. It might be appropriate to devote one paragraph to each of the major findings, and to provide more detailed treatment to the most important ones. Discussion should address limitations and answer why those limitations are not problematic for the objectives of the study. Discussion section could be typically between 1500-3000 words.\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that word count is only a rough guideline, and the content and organization of the results and discussion are more important than the length.

This was in comparison to the standard cross-entropy loss, as indicated in Table \\ref{tab:cross entropy vs cosine loss}, with an average improvement of approximately \\textbf{0.017} across all experiments. We argue that this outcome is largely attributable to the intrinsic nature of cross-entropy loss, which necessitates a large volume of data to effectively train a model capable of accurately predicting the probabilities of an input belonging to each class. Conversely, the cosine similarity loss places emphasis on the angle between vectors rather than their magnitudes. This distinction proves advantageous for maximizing differentiation between classes, thereby enhancing inter-class separability. It promotes the notion that each class should have a unique direction in the embedding space. Moreover, the cosine similarity loss function encourages intra-class compactness. This suggests that data points from the same class are influenced to have similar embeddings, resulting in the formation of tightly-knit clusters.",

Despite past investigations on the design of workspaces in VEs in terms of scale, texture, complexity, etc., depending on its respective platform and designers, there has been a lack of understanding of the correlation between spatial design and interaction. This paper focuses on how spatial scale perception impacts interpersonal interactions in VEs. Our experimental design consists of a 2 x 2 within-subject, with each session including a story retrieval collaborative task to observe interpersonal interactions and distance estimation. The independent variables are high or low complexity and situational or environmental factors, and the dependent variables are interpersonal interaction (verbal and nonverbal) along with perceived spatial scale. The results of this study confirmed our proposed hypotheses. First, the perceived spatial scale decreased as the complexity of the virtual space increased. Second, interpersonal interaction increased as the perceived spatial scale decreased. The contribution of our study is that we have identified the correlation between spatial design and interpersonal interaction. Based on this, we present future insights to virtual workspace designers and engineers on designing virtual spaces for effective remote collaboration. ",

The meat should be of high quality and should contain enough fat to ensure its flavor and juiciness. Additionally, you will need 20 cloves of garlic, 2 tablespoons of Korean soybean paste, a tablespoon of ground coffee, a few stalks of spring onion, and 5-6 bay leaves. Once you have all the ingredients, make sure to rinse the meat in cold water and pat it dry with paper towels before placing it in a large pot.

It's important to make clear the methods you used to extract the information relevant to your research question and how you went about comparing and contrasting the findings from these studies.\n\nYou may also consider discussing any limitations that may arise from your selection process, such as publication bias. For instance, did you only include studies that presented positive or significant results for efficiency and accuracy? Or did you find studies with negative or null results as well?

Here are some key points to look for in each of their methodology sections.\n\nIn the first paper, \"Leveraging Passage Retrieval with Generative Models for Open Domain Question Answering,\" the authors discuss their development of a new generative model that uses a retrieval-based approach to open domain question answering. They then describe the specific datasets they used to test their model's effectiveness against previously established models. Look for how the authors created the datasets, and how they chose the types of questions they asked to evaluate the model.\n\nIn the second paper, \"Generate rather than Retrieve: Large Language Models are Strong Context Generators,\" the authors focus on a different approach to open domain question answering, using large language models rather than retrieval-based models. In their methodology section, they describe how they created a pretraining setup, how they fine-tuned the model, and how they evaluated it against other models. Pay attention to how they describe the process of pretraining and fine-tuning, and what specific metrics they used to evaluate their model's performance.\n\nIn the third paper, \"Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering,\" the authors focus on passage retrieval for open domain question answering. They describe how they used a dense retrieval method to identify passages that were then used to answer questions. In the methodology section, they detail the datasets they used, and how they identified or created the passages used in their model. Pay attention to how they define \"dense retrieval,\" and the specific process they used to select passages.\n\nI hope this helps give you some ideas for what to look for in the methodology sections of these papers.

In this paper, we propose an effective open domain QA approach for Chinese, based on Baidu's relation extraction system. Specifically, our approach performs keyword extraction to obtain the candidate set of documents, and then retrieves relation facts from those documents. By using a new relevance ranking scheme, our approach is able to rank the answer candidates with high accuracy. Experimental results on benchmarks show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on open domain QA for Chinese. \n\nI hope this helps!",

You should start by reading and summarizing recent academic articles, conference proceedings, and unpublished preprints related to debiasing contextual word embeddings. Then identify the common themes and trends in each of the studies.\n\n4. **Identify evaluation metrics** - Evaluation of debiasing contextual word embeddings is critical to their adoption. There are several metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed debiasing techniques such as critique of Word Embedding Methods and Analysis (WEAT). This is essential for assessing the effectiveness of these techniques in addressing the bias in contextual word embeddings.\n\n5. **Discuss challenges and future directions** - In the field of debiasing contextual word embeddings, there are still challenges and gaps that need to be tackled. As you review your literature, identify those gaps and challenges and suggest possible avenues for future research. Examples of such challenges include the need to deal with imbalanced classes, the extent to which biases can be truly eliminated, among others.\n\n6. **Write a clear and organized paper** - Write clearly and concisely while also making it easy for readers to follow your line of reasoning. Be sure to mention references when discussing concepts and ideas presented in each paper or study, and provide a summary of the main finding or the methodology used.\n\nI hope this game plan helps to guide your work in writing an informative and comprehensive review paper!",

A systematic review may present a quantitative synthesis of results from multiple studies, whereas a narrative review may present qualitative summaries of studies based on the reviewer's interpretation or experiences.",

        "response": "Sure, I'd be happy to. A systematic review is a type of review article that uses a rigorous and transparent methodology to identify and analyze all the published and unpublished literature surrounding a particular research question. The goal of a systematic review is to synthesize the results of multiple studies in a way that minimizes bias and provides a comprehensive summary of the available evidence on a particular topic. One way that systematic reviews present results is by using meta-analysis, which is a statistical technique that combines the results from multiple studies into a single quantitative measure of effect size.\n\nIn contrast to systematic reviews, narrative reviews are often less structured and rigorous. Narrative reviews rely on the expertise, opinions, and interpretations of the authors of the review, rather than using a predetermined and systematic methodology for selecting and analyzing studies. Because of this, narrative reviews may be more susceptible to bias and may present a more subjective view of the available evidence. The results in a narrative review may be presented more qualitatively, with summaries and interpretations of studies based on the reviewer's understanding of the evidence. \n\nDoes that help clarify the difference between systematic and narrative reviews?",

However, these embeddings also have the potential to encode various biases, such as those related to gender, age, and ethnicity. The issue of debiasing contextual word embeddings has thus become a critical topic in the field. We aim to survey different debiasing methods that have been proposed, such as retraining models on more diverse data, incorporating specific constraints into the training process, and using post-processing techniques to remove biases.

Repeating findings: Sometimes authors repeat the same results over and over again. This can cause the reader to get bored and may make it seem like you are trying to fill space.\n\n2. Not using visuals properly: As we already discussed, using visuals is important, but if they are not used correctly, they can be misleading, unclear or even unnecessary. Make sure that they are well-designed, properly labeled, and have sufficient information.\n\n3. Ignoring negative results: Negative results are important too, and should not be ignored. Make sure to include results that did not support your hypothesis or research questions, and explain why these results may have occurred.\n\n4. Being overly descriptive: Being too descriptive can make your results section too long and boring. While it is essential to describe the results accurately, focus on important information and avoid irrelevant detail.\n\n5. Not staying objective: It is important to stay objective while writing the results section. Avoid making subjective interpretations, and use clear, unbiased language to describe your results.\n\nThese are some of the typical mistakes, but you can avoid them by being attentive, objective, and thoughtful while writing the results section of your research.

Journal articles have a more standardized structure, which is based on the IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) framework.\n\nOn the other hand, review articles don't usually present new data but summarize and evaluate existing research in a specific field. The results section is less structured, and instead of highlighting original research, it is more focused on summarizing the results of multiple studies in a particular area. In review articles, the author summarizes and synthesizes existing findings to support or refute existing hypotheses or theories. Therefore, the results section in review articles may use tables or figures to display results from different studies, rather than relying on a presentation of original data.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary difference between the results section of journal articles and review articles is that journal articles present original findings, while review articles summarize previously published studies in a particular field.",

Thus, your results section in a review article would discuss the key findings or the most important pieces of information you have gathered from the studies that you have reviewed. Your results section in a review article may include data presented in the form of tables or figures, which you can use to summarize the findings from the studies you have reviewed. However, you should focus on presenting the main messages and themes that emerged from the studies you've reviewed and not simply on summarizing every detail of each individual study. Your discussion section should then interpret these findings and explain how they contribute to the larger picture of your topic or research question.",

Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you're doing a good job clearly summarizing the main research question you're trying to address in your review paper, and you're integrating your findings efficiently.\n\nAs you're writing your results section, I recommend the following tips to optimize your writing:\n\n1. Methodically present your findings: Try to present your results in a logical and coherent order by clearly identifying key insights that demonstrate similarities and differences across the three different architectures. Look for themes and patterns that emerge and summarize those patterns in a clear and precise way.\n\n2. Use charts or graphs: Use charts or graphs to visually convey complicated numerical data or results. Keep your graphs clean and simple, including only the essential information, avoiding clutter.\n\n3. Report negative results: If you don't obtain statistically significant results or find no differences between some architectures, don’t hesitate to report these results. Negative results can still be valuable, and they contribute to broader audience knowledge.\n\n4. Keep your results clearly focused on your research question: In writing your results section, ensure that you are succinctly highlighting only the findings that are most relevant to your research question. Don’t lose sight of your research question, even as you discover interesting results outside the scope of your initial inquiry.\n\nDoes that help?

Here's a rough outline for a sample results section based on the information you provided earlier.\n\nResults:\nIn this section, we present the main findings from each of the three papers and compare and contrast the performance of the different architectures.\n\n**Paper 1: Dense Passage Retrieval**\nDense Passage Retrieval (DPR) is an architecture focused on retrieving relevant contexts for open domain QA. The paper showed that DPR outperforms several other methods on well-known benchmarks, including the Natural Questions test set. However, the architecture is not compute-efficient, which can limit its scalability in real-world settings.\n\n**Paper 2: GenRead**\nGenRead is a relatively new architecture that aims to generate relevant contexts directly. The results from the paper show that while GenRead has some advantages over DPR, it suffers from hallucination, which can impact its overall performance.\n\n**Paper 3: Fusion in Decoder**\nFusion in Decoder (FiD) is a state-of-the-art reader that combines encoding and decoding steps into a single model. While FiD showed impressive results in terms of accuracy, it can be extremely computationally expensive and may not scale well in real-world settings.\n\nComparing the different architectures, we find that while FiD performs well in terms of accuracy, it requires significantly more compute resources than the other two methods. On the other hand, DPR is computationally efficient but may not provide the same level of accuracy as FiD. GenRead performs well on certain benchmarks but has some limitations in terms of hallucination. By comparing the strengths and weaknesses of each architecture, we can begin to identify which methods may be better suited for different use cases.\n\nOverall, the results suggest that there is no single \"best\" architecture for open domain QA, and that the choice of architecture will depend on specific use cases and application requirements.",

        "response": "Open-domain Question Answering (QA) [1] is the task of answering questions posed by users without relying on a specific database or knowledge graph. Instead, open-domain QA systems must be able to process and analyze a wide range of text sources to provide accurate and relevant answers to queries. Open domain QA has the potential to enhance information access and utilization by allowing users to input queries in natural language, and obtaining accurate and pertinent answers. Open-domain QA systems can improve the capacity to locate, process and apply knowledge on various domains. However, despite the significant progress in recent years, open-domain QA remains a challenging problem due to several factors, including the vast amount of information available online, the diversity of sources like Wikipedia and web crawl, and the need to understand and interpret natural language.\nTo tackle this challenge, researchers have explored various approaches to open-domain QA, ranging from traditional retrieval-based methods to more recent generative models. In recent years, there has been substantial progress in the field with 3 prominent approaches to open domain QA. The retrieve then read (DPR) [2], retrieve then generate (FiD) [3] and the generate then read (GenRead) [4] pipelines where each of these has its own benefits and drawbacks. \nDPR [2] relies on a retrieval-based method where the system first retrieves relevant documents based on the question and then extracts the answer from the retrieved documents. This approach can tackle the challenge of diversity of sources by leveraging multiple sources of information to find relevant documents. However, it may struggle with understanding complex questions or generating more nuanced answers.\nFiD [3] also relies on a retrieval-based method to retrieve relevant documents but then it generates an answer based on these retrieved documents using a generative model. This approach can handle the challenge of generating more accurate and nuanced answers, but it may require a large amount of training data and be computationally expensive.\nGenRead [4] on the other hand is based on a generative model that directly generates context which is then used to find the answer without relying on retrieval. While this approach has the potential to generate more intuitive and informative answers, the accuracy of the answers is highly dependent on the ability of the model to generate appropriate context. Additionally, generative models may be slower than the retrieval models, as they require additional time for context generation.\nKey differences between these approaches include their reliance on retrieval versus generation, their use of pre-trained models, and their focus on efficiency versus accuracy. While generative models may provide more accurate answers, they can be computationally expensive and require a large amount of training data. Retrieval-based approaches, on the other hand, may be more efficient, but may struggle with understanding complex questions or generating more nuanced answers., \nGiven the complexity and diversity of approaches to open-domain QA, there is a need for a comprehensive survey paper that can provide a comparative analysis of recent developments, and identify promising directions for future research. Our survey paper aims to fill this gap by systematically reviewing and comparing the three papers mentioned earlier, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses, and providing insights into their potential for improving open-domain QA. By doing so, we hope to provide a roadmap for future research in this exciting and rapidly evolving field. In addition, our survey paper may help to identify new research questions and challenges that have not yet been addressed, and may inspire new approaches and techniques for tackling the open-domain QA problem. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the most recent developments, and to highlight the key trends and challenges in the field.\nThe methodology section of this review paper on the recent studies in open domain Question Answering (QA) outlines the systematic process employed to identify and select relevant research articles for the review. Open domain QA is an essential task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves answering questions based on a given context without any specific domain knowledge. The area of open domain QA is constantly evolving, with new approaches and techniques being proposed and evaluated regularly. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a rigorous and comprehensive review to identify the most effective and promising approaches, and highlight areas of research that require further investigation. In this section, we describe the search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and data extraction process used to select and analyze relevant research articles.\nThe methodology employed for this review paper was highly selective, and aimed to focus on three main publications that cover different pipelines for open domain QA. A comprehensive literature search was initially conducted on major scientific databases, such as Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect, to identify relevant research articles published from 2018 to 2023. The search terms used were \"open domain question answering\", \"open-domain QA\", \"information retrieval\", \"natural language processing\", and \"generative retrieval\". The search was conducted in March 2023, and yielded a total of 568 articles.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria: The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies that proposed innovative approaches for open domain QA; (2) studies that showed promising improvements in the existing benchmarks of Trivia-QA [6], Natural Questions [5], Web-Q [7], and SQuAD datasets [1]; (3) studies published in English; (4) studies published in peer-reviewed journals or conferences. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies that focused on domain-specific QA; (2) studies that did not provide sufficient details on the proposed approach; (3) studies that were not published in English; (4) studies that were not peer-reviewed.\nTo finalize the selection of articles for this review, a rigorous screening process was employed. After screening the titles and abstracts of the identified articles, relevant studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The full texts of the selected articles were then reviewed, and relevant data was extracted, including the year of publication, datasets used, evaluation metrics, proposed approach, and results. The selection process was highly selective, and only three publications were included in the review paper based on their relevance, originality, and contribution to the field of open domain QA.\nThe extracted data was analyzed to identify trends and patterns in recent approaches for open domain QA. The proposed approaches were categorized based on their underlying pipelines, including retrieve-read [4], retrieve-generate [3], and generate-read [2]. The evaluation metrics used in the studies were also analyzed to identify the most commonly used metrics, and highlight the challenges in evaluating open domain QA systems. Finally, the quality of the selected articles was assessed based on the following criteria: relevance, validity, reliability, and usability. The final three publications selected for this review paper were deemed to be of high quality, demonstrate originality, and provide a significant contribution to the field of open domain QA. \n\nIn this section, we present the key findings and results obtained from a comprehensive review of three influential papers in the field of open domain question answering. The papers under examination are, “Dense Passage Retrieval”,” Fusion in Decoder,” and” Generate Rather than Retrieve!” These papers explore different approaches and techniques aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of open domain question answering systems. By critically analysing the methodologies and experimental results of each paper, this review aims to provide valuable insights into the current state-of-the-art methods in this rapidly evolving field. Table 1 provides an overview of the performance of all three models on NQ (Kwiatkowski et.al, 2019, TriviaQA A (Joshi et al., 2017), and WebQ (Berant et al., 2013) datasets, showcasing their comparative strengths and weaknesses.\n“Dense Passage Retrieval” introduces a novel approach to open domain question answering by leveraging dense representations of passages instead of traditional sparse retrievals (Robertson and Zaragoza, 2009). The key findings of this study demonstrate that dense passage retrieval methods significantly outperform sparse retrievals in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency. By employing pre-trained language models and utilizing dense vector representations, the authors showcase the potential of this approach for improving information retrieval and subsequent question answering performance. “Fusion in Decoder” investigates the integration of fusion techniques within the decoding phase of open domain question answering models. The primary objective of this research is to enhance the integration of multi-modal information (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Robertson and Zaragoza, 2009) during the generation of answers. The key findings reveal that incorporating fusion mechanisms, such as attention-based fusion and cross-modal gating, leads to improved answer quality, better alignment between questions and answers, and enhanced overall performance of the system. This work highlights the significance of fusion techniques in capturing diverse sources of information and effectively leveraging them during the decoding process. “Generate Rather than Retrieve!” explores an alternative paradigm for open domain question answering by focusing on generating answers directly instead of relying on retrieval-based approaches (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2017). This approach employs sequence-to-sequence models to generate relevant contexts, which are then utilized by the reader to find or generate an answer. The key findings of this study demonstrate that generating answers without explicit retrieval can yield competitive performance, especially in scenarios where retrieval-based methods face challenges, such as long-tail queries or out-of-domain questions. This work emphasizes the potential of generative models as a promising avenue for open domain question answering.\nWhile all three papers contribute to the advancement of open domain question answering, they approach the problem from different angles. “Dense Passage Retrieval” (DPR) was the first to be introduced among the three, serving as a solid baseline and providing a starting point for comparison. Although its results may lag behind” Fusion in Decoder” (FiD) and” Generate Rather than Retrieve!” (GenRead), DPR establishes a strong foundation in the field. FiD, while showcasing impressive results, is computationally expensive, which limits its practical use in certain scenarios. On the other hand, GenRead demonstrates results that appear superior to the other two approaches. However, being a generative model, it can suffer from the challenge of extreme hallucination, where it confidently generates answers that may not be accurate or relevant. It becomes evident that there is no single best model, as each approach excels in certain aspects while lagging behind in others. Therefore, further research is necessary to refine and improve each of these models before a final, optimal solution can be determined.\n",

Based on your research, it is clear that open-domain question answering (QA) is a challenging problem that requires the ability to process and analyze a wide range of text sources to provide accurate and relevant answers to queries. In recent years, researchers have explored various approaches to open-domain QA, ranging from traditional retrieval-based methods to more recent generative models.\n\nYour review of recent developments in open-domain QA has identified three prominent approaches, including retrieve then read (DPR), retrieve then generate (FiD), and generate then read (GenRead) pipelines.

Typically, the organizational flow of a data commentary paragraph in scientific writing can be broken down into four main parts - a topic sentence, the data itself, an explanation of the data, and a link to the next paragraph. \n\nThe topic sentence should introduce the main idea or point of the paragraph, and the data should be presented in a clear and concise manner, using appropriate charts or figures where necessary. The explanation of the data should focus on why the data is important, what trends or patterns emerge from it, and how it supports your argument or research question.\n\nIn most cases, the last sentence of the paragraph should provide a smooth transition to the next section or paragraph. This can be done by linking the idea in the current paragraph to the next one, or by summarizing the key points of the current paragraph before moving on.\n\nOverall, it's important to keep in mind that the organization of the data commentary paragraph will ultimately depend on the research question and the data being presented, so there may be variations in the specific flow and structure depending on the context.",

Here are some basic steps to get started with using AntConc:\n\n1. Create a corpus - A corpus is simply a collection of texts that you want to analyze. You can create a corpus in AntConc by either adding individual files or by selecting a folder that contains all of the files you want to analyze.\n\n2. Set the parameters - Once you have created your corpus, you'll need to set some parameters to determine what type of analysis you want to run. These parameters include, for example, the type of analysis (e.g. word frequency, concordance, collocation), the type of data you want to analyze (e.g. letters, words, phrases), and the settings for case sensitivity and word boundaries.\n\n3. Run the analysis - After you have set the parameters, you can run the analysis by clicking on the \"Start\" button. The results will be displayed in the main window of AntConc, and you can explore them further by clicking on the various tabs (e.g. word list, concordance, collocates).\n\n4. Interpret the results - Finally, you'll need to interpret the results of the analysis. This will involve looking for patterns and trends in the data, as well as identifying any interesting or unexpected findings. Once you have a sense of what the data is telling you, you can use this information to draw conclusions or make further predictions.\n\nI hope this gives you a better idea of what AntConc is and how to use it.

        "response": "Certainly! Concordance and collocates are two of the main features in AntConc, and they allow you to analyze your text data in different ways.\n\nA concordance is a list of all the occurrences of a particular word or phrase in your corpus, along with some context about where and how it appears. For example, if you run a concordance for the word \"science\" in your scientific writing project, you'll get a list of all the sentences that contain the word \"science\" and some surrounding text that provides context. This can help you to see how the word is used and understand its different meanings and connotations.\n\nCollocates, on the other hand, are words that often appear in close proximity to each other in your corpus. For example, if you run a collocation analysis for the word \"science\" in your scientific writing project, you might find that the word \"scientific\" is a common collocate, indicating that \"science\" is often used in conjunction with \"scientific.\" This can be helpful for understanding how words are used in context and identifying patterns or associations that might not be immediately obvious.\n\nOverall, both concordances and collocates can help you to gain a better understanding of your text data and identify interesting patterns or trends that you might not have noticed otherwise.",

This type of analysis requires a more sophisticated understanding of the relationships between words, and may be difficult for an AI language model to perform with the same level of accuracy.\n\n2. Keyword analysis: AntConc allows you to identify the most significant or relevant words or phrases in a corpus based on a set of specific criteria. This type of analysis requires a more nuanced understanding of the semantics of language and the meaning of words in context, which may be difficult for an AI language model to replicate.\n\n3. Regular expression searches: AntConc allows you to use regular expressions (a type of pattern matching language) to search for specific patterns or combinations of words in your corpus. This type of analysis is highly flexible and powerful, and may be difficult for an AI language model to execute with the same precision and efficiency as AntConc.\n\nOverall, while AI language models like myself can perform many of the functions of AntConc, there are certainly some advanced features that would be difficult or impossible to replicate.",

Let me give you a specific example of concordance and collocates:\n\nConcordance: Let's say you're analyzing a text and you want to see how the word \"energy\" is used throughout the text. You can use the concordance function in AntConc to identify every instance of the word \"energy\" in the text, along with the words that come before and after it. This can help you identify common themes or patterns in how the word is used. For example, you might notice that the word \"energy\" is often used in the context of renewable energy sources.\n\nCollocates: Let's say you're analyzing a different text and you want to see which words tend to be used together with the word \"ocean\". You can use the collocates tool in AntConc to identify which words occur most frequently in the same context as \"ocean\". This can help you identify common word combinations or phrases that are used together. For example, you might notice that the word \"ocean\" is often used in the context of \"marine life\" or \"ocean currents\". This can help you gain a better understanding of the key themes or concepts that are related to the word \"ocean\". \n\nDo these examples help clarify concordance and collocates for you?",

Multiple corpus analysis: AntConc can analyze multiple corpora simultaneously, which is particularly useful for comparative analysis across datasets or languages. This feature allows users to identify patterns and differences in language that are not immediately obvious from single corpus analysis.\n\n2. Part of speech tagging: AntConc can automatically tag words with their part of speech, allowing users to perform more in-depth analysis of grammatical patterns and usage. This feature is particularly useful for analyzing syntax, and identifying patterns of verb tense, noun-adjective pairs, and other grammatical features.\n\n3. Concordance plot: This feature creates a graphical representation of the concordance analysis results, providing a visual summary of how a particular word is used throughout the text. This is a particularly useful feature for identifying patterns and trends in language usage.\n\n4. Word list clustering: This feature allows users to group words with similar usage patterns together, helping to identify clusters of related terminology. This can be particularly useful for creating specialized dictionaries, or identifying related concepts in a large text corpus.\n\nThese advanced features require specialized algorithms and computational techniques that are not available in a general-purpose language model like me.

This could be the person who designed the study, collected and analyzed the data, or wrote the manuscript. \n\nThe last author is often the senior author, who may have provided funding, guidance, or mentorship throughout the project. \n\nThe middle authors are typically listed in order of their contribution to the project, with the person who made the second most significant contribution listed second, and so on. \n\nIt's important to note that authorship should be based on actual contributions to the project, rather than just being listed as a courtesy or because of their position in the lab or department. \n\nDoes that help answer your question?",

However, they still rely on the LR and HR climate data pairs. The unavailability of paired low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) data in the climate downscaling problem prompted Singh et al. [10] to introduce a self-supervised climate downscaling model. This model learns the climate data distribution using only a single LR datum, without using HR data as the ground truth in model training. Instead, the authors generated a pair of pseudo-LR and pseudo-HR data from the original HR climate data, which were then used in the model training. The authors used the SRResNet architecture as the backbone of their climate downscaling model and downscaled two climate variables, temperature, and precipitation, to 2x and 4x larger resolution. The overall flow of their model is illustrated in Figure 5.",

        "response": "Hi! Attached below is my written conclusion. A feedback that I got from the Professor is to explicitly state the implication of the study. Can you elaborate on how I can do that? Can you give examples on that?:\n\n\n A new composite material, UiO-67/graphene oxide (UiO-67/GO), with improved hydrogen storage capabilities, has been reported. The inclusion of GO in UiO-67 resulted in enhanced adsorbent characteristics, including increased surface area and micropore volume. Among all the MOF/GO composites, the resulting UiO-67/GO composite exhibited one of the highest surface areas (c.a. 2743 m2/g) and showed the most significant improvement (6.5%) in surface area compared to previously synthesized UiO-67/GO composites. This was achieved by focusing on nanosizing the MOFs prior to composite synthesis, leading to a hybrid material with synergistic effects in gas adsorption processes. The study emphasized the importance of MOF size in composite formation.\n\nThe structural and physical improvements of the UiO-67/GO composite were evident in its 60% enhancement of hydrogen uptake at 1 bar and 77 K. This is due to the additional spaces created with the incorporation of GO; thereby, providing more spaces for hydrogen molecules. While current adsorbents fall short of meeting specific targets for hydrogen fuel vehicles, synthesizing composites can further enhance hydrogen storage performance. The UiO-67/GO composite demonstrated promising potential as an attractive hydrogen adsorbent, particularly at low pressures and temperatures commonly used in hydrogen storage systems. Current hydrogen storage systems already utilizes liquid nitrogen chilling to store energy. Therefore, UiO-67/GO as a hydrogen adsorbent is suitable in this kind of systems.\n\nIt's important to note that the hydrogen uptake performance of the UiO-67/GO composite was only evaluated at 1 bar and 77 K. Further characterization at higher pressures and temperatures will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the material's capabilities as a hydrogen adsorbent. Future studies will focus on investigating the material under these conditions. Moreover, the use of these composites as an adsorbent to facilitate other types of gas storage such as carbon dioxide and methane could also be explored.\n ",

It usually includes a thesis statement that outlines the purpose and scope of the research. \n\nA conclusion, on the other hand, is the final section of a research paper that summarizes the main findings and implications of the research. It is usually used to tie together the various sections of the paper and provide a final statement on the topic. \n\nSo, while all three sections serve different purposes, the abstract is unique in that it provides a brief summary of the entire paper, while the introduction and conclusion focus more on providing context and summarizing the main findings, respectively.

The survey is composed of four sections each section described in Tabe 1 to 4 respectively. Table 1 shows the time spent on doing four different tasks to prepare for the CC500 class. Completing writing tasks took the longest time, with a majority of the students taking longer than 2 hours to finish the homework. Then it is followed by reading the text most students take at least an hour to complete it. Table 2 shows students’ thoughts on the video content. Regarding understandability, helpfulness, video length, and overall satisfaction, all students were positive about the video content. There are 0 responses of strongly disagreeing, disagreeing, and neither agreeing nor disagreeing on every four attributes. Furthermore, more percentage of students strongly agreed with the video content appropriateness than agree. This indicates that students are very satisfied with the current video content. The responses on the appropriateness of textbook content in four attributes (understandability, helpfulness, content amount, and overall satisfaction) are depicted in Table 3. Unlike video content, with all affirmative feedback, 18% of students disagreed that the amount of reading is appropriate. This can be related to the data 57.8% of students spent more than 1 hour reading the text, even 1 student taking more than 4 hours in Table 1. Table 4 presents responses on classroom content in five attributes (understandability, time spent on checking homework, interaction between students, interaction between teacher and students, and overall satisfaction). All students at least agreed that the class is understandable and were overall satisfied. However, 10.5% of students neither agreed nor disagreed with the time spent on checking homework. This relates to the additional feedback from a student claiming that “too much things” are to be discussed and that sometimes we “skip half of the activities”. In conclusion, all students were generally satisfied with the class. However, around 20% of the students thought the time spent reading the text took too long. A way is to shorten the homework.\n",

        "response": "Thanks for sharing your writing with me. I see a few areas where you could make some improvements. \n\nFirst, when you introduce Table 1, you say \"Completing writing tasks took the longest time, with a majority of the students taking longer than 2 hours to finish the homework.\" However, the data in Table 1 actually shows that only 47.4% of students spent more than 2 hours on writing tasks. This is still a significant percentage, but it's not a majority. \n\nSecond, in the paragraph that discusses Table 3, you say \"18% of students disagreed that the amount of reading is appropriate.\" However, the data in Table 3 shows that 18% of students neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement about the amount of reading. This is a subtle but important difference - they didn't necessarily disagree, they simply didn't have an opinion. \n\nLastly, throughout your writing, you could work on varying your word choices and sentence structure for clarity and readability. For example, in the last sentence of your introduction, you write \"This indicates that students are very satisfied with the current video content.\" You could use a more descriptive verb than \"indicates\" here, and you could try rephrasing the sentence to make it more concise and impactful. \n\nOverall, your writing is clear and straightforward, and you do a good job of summarizing the data from the survey. With some revisions to improve accuracy and sentence structure, your writing could be even clearer and more engaging.",

Therefore, control; the ability to specify desired attributes of the text at test time, is important to fix errors.

The paper used two methods Conditional Training (CT) and Weighted Decoding (WD) to control the four low-level attributes and found that while controlling question-asking, repetition had positive effects on human judgment aspects, increasing specificity decreased making sense and fluency while increasing response-relatedness decreased making sense, fluency, humanness, and engagingness.

When it comes to article usage in scientific writing, it's less about whether a noun is proper or common and more about whether it's specific or general. Specifically, when we use \"a\" or \"an,\" we're indicating that the noun we're referring to is indefinite or general, while when we use \"the,\" we're indicating that the noun is definite or specific. So, for example, if we were discussing a new finding in a journal article and we said, \"A recent study found that...\", we're talking about a general finding, whereas if we said, \"The study conducted by Smith and Jones in 2020 found that...\", we're talking about a specific study.

This happens in a few parts: sugar breaking, acid circle, and electric moving thing. Sugar breaking is in the cell goo and turns sugar into two other things, making some energy and another thing called NADH. The acid circle, or that Krebs thing, is in the cell's power house and makes more ATP, NADH, and a different thing called FADH2. At last, the electric moving thing uses the bits from NADH and FADH2 to make some power across the power house's inside part, which helps make most of a cell's ATP with the help of oxygen and putting things together.\"\n\nThis is revised:\nCellular respiration is a fundamental process in which cells convert the energy stored in glucose molecules into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary molecule responsible for powering cellular activities. This process occurs in three stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain. Glycolysis takes place in the cell's cytoplasm and breaks glucose down into two molecules of pyruvate, releasing energy in the form of ATP and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, occurs in the mitochondria and generates additional ATP, NADH, and another electron carrier called flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2). Finally, the electron transport chain uses the electrons from NADH and FADH2 to generate a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which drives the synthesis of the majority of a cell's ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.",

It is about a neural network that generates rhythm games beatmaps from music.\n\nThe neural network, taking a 1D tensor representing the characteristics of a single audio file as input, produces a sequence of synchronized time-action pairs ready to be converted into the chosen beatmap format. This end-to-end approach was preferred over the separation of the problem into multiple subtasks, namely action placement and action selection, which is commonly used in the beatmap generation domain. Since transformers have obtained incredible results in many sequence-to-sequence tasks in terms of quality and parallelization potential, and are able to handle long sequences of data better than LSTM-based networks, a standard encoder-decoder transformer implementation was chosen as a generation model.",

The paper describes a system that generates levels for a video game based on the characteristics of a piece of music. Because both music analysis for level generation and beatmap generation involve using audio data to generate levels, the student's decision to use a neural network to process audio data for beatmap generation is supported by this paper's approach to using music for level generation.",

The results showed that the proposed algorithm was successful in generating beatmaps that were closely matched to the input music tracks in both rhythm patterns and timing, with an overall accuracy rate of 88% and a mean squared error of 0.0237. This suggests that the proposed algorithm represents a promising approach to automatic beatmap generation and has significant implications for the gaming industry.\n\nMoving forward, there is a great potential for further research in this area. Specifically, researchers could look at expanding the scope of this study to other genres of music or another rhythm-based media beyond video games. Moreover, possible future research direction could include investigating the optimization algorithms and machine learning-based models to improve the accuracy and efficiency of beatmap generation. Finally, exploring the use of virtual reality and haptic feedback technologies in conjunction with automatic beatmap generation has the potential for further enhancing the immersive experience of rhythm gaming.\n\nThe developed algorithm could have practical applications, especially for amateur video game developers who may not have the resources or expertise to create precise and engaging beatmaps manually. In addition, health care practitioners, particularly those focused on rehabilitation, could use this technology as a tool to promote the recovery of both fine motor and cognitive skills in patients. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the potential for automatic rhythm game beatmap generation to deliver new and exciting gameplay experiences in the gaming industry and beyond.\"",

Moreover, possible future research direction could include investigating the optimization algorithms and machine learning-based models to improve the accuracy and efficiency of beatmap generation. Finally, exploring the use of virtual reality and haptic feedback technologies in conjunction with automatic beatmap generation has the potential for further enhancing the immersive experience of rhythm gaming.\n\nThe developed algorithm could have practical applications, especially for amateur video game developers who may not have the resources or expertise to create precise and engaging beatmaps manually. In addition, health care practitioners, particularly those focused on rehabilitation, could use this technology as a tool to promote the recovery of both fine motor and cognitive skills in patients.

A level of a rhythm game, called \"beatmap\" or \"chart\", is therefore a pattern of actions mapped on a sequence of musical beats that reflects the features of a song.\nSince the beatmaps are usually handcrafted, rhythm games come with a limited number of available songs, and the addition process takes a long time. Moreover, while many players want to try different charts for the same song when they master a pattern, most games don't give this opportunity. To make up for the lack of their favorite songs, players use editors to manually create and share their own maps, but this task is very time-consuming and repetitive, and the alignment of beats and actions requires great attention to detail.\nThe aim of this research is to automatically generate a high-quality, fun beatmap of the specified type and difficulty for any song using a deep learning algorithm, more specifically a transformer architecture.

The core of a rhythm game is a level called a \"beatmap\" or \"chart,\" which is essentially a pattern mapped onto a sequence of musical beats that mirrors the features of a song. However, since developers handcraft beatmaps, rhythm games usually have a limited library of songs for players to choose from, and adding new songs can be a long and tedious process. Additionally, most games do not permit players to test their skills with different charts for the same song. As a result, players typically use editors to create and share their own beatmaps, but this task is time-consuming and requires significant attention to detail when aligning beats and actions.\n\nThe aim of this research is to address the issue of beatmap creation by developing a deep learning algorithm that can automatically generate high-quality, fun beatmaps of various types and difficulty levels for any song. Specifically, the proposed algorithm will use a transformer architecture to analyze the audio features of a given song and generate a corresponding beatmap that reflects the song's rhythm and melody. To evaluate the algorithm's performance, we will define a set of rules for quality assessment that can be generalized across various rhythm games. By the end of this study, we hope to demonstrate that it is possible to automate the creation of beatmaps, which can significantly reduce the workload of developers and players alike.",

However, creating new beatmaps by hand can be challenging, time-consuming and requires significant attention to detail, which reduces the total number of songs a game can have. To address this, we propose the development of a deep learning algorithm that can automatically generate high-quality, fun beatmaps of various types and difficulty levels for any song. By doing so, we aim  to achieve four main contributions: \n\nFirst, we aim to achieve better results than previous works in terms of beatmap quality by tokenizing the data in a MIDI-like fashion and conditioning the transformer on various features, such as the difficulty level, genre, etc.\n\nSecond, we will define a model or a set of guidelines to evaluate beatmap quality more objectively, at least for a certain subset of beatmaps, since chart evaluation is largely subjective and there are no universal guidelines to follow.\n\nThird, we will generalize the algorithm’s application field from one game to many since many rhythm games have different ways of creating beatmaps. We will do this by, for instance, applying weight sharing techniques to the model when training it on different datasets.\n\nLastly, we will find valuable training data for music annotation purposes which can, in turn, help in the development of new music-related tools and models going forward. \n\nBy the end of this study, we hope to demonstrate that it is possible to automate the creation of beatmaps, which can significantly reduce the workload of developers and players alike.",

A level of a rhythm game, called \"beatmap\" or \"chart\", is therefore a pattern of actions mapped on a sequence of musical beats that reflects the features of a song.\nSince the beatmaps are usually handcrafted, rhythm games come with a limited number of available songs, and the addition process takes a long time. Moreover, while many players want to try different charts for the same song when they master a pattern, most games don't give this opportunity.

The core of a rhythm game is a level called a \"beatmap\" or \"chart,\" which is essentially a pattern mapped onto a sequence of musical beats that mirrors the features of a song. However, since developers handcraft beatmaps, rhythm games usually have a limited library of songs for players to choose from, and adding new songs can be a long and tedious process. Additionally, most games do not permit players to test their skills with different charts for the same song. As a result, players typically use editors to create and share their own beatmaps, but this task is time-consuming and requires significant attention to detail when aligning beats and actions.\n\nThe aim of this research is to address the issue of beatmap creation by developing a deep learning algorithm that can automatically generate high-quality, fun beatmaps of various types and difficulty levels for any song. Specifically, the proposed algorithm will use a transformer architecture to analyze the audio features of a given song and generate a corresponding beatmap that reflects the song's rhythm and melody. To evaluate the algorithm's performance, we will define a set of rules for quality assessment that can be generalized across various rhythm games. By the end of this study, we hope to demonstrate that it is possible to automate the creation of beatmaps, which can significantly reduce the workload of developers and players alike.",

However, creating new beatmaps by hand can be challenging, time-consuming and requires significant attention to detail, which reduces the total number of songs a game can have. To address this, we propose the development of a deep learning algorithm that can automatically generate high-quality, fun beatmaps of various types and difficulty levels for any song. By doing so, we aim  to achieve four main contributions: \n\nFirst, we aim to achieve better results than previous works in terms of beatmap quality by tokenizing the data in a MIDI-like fashion and conditioning the transformer on various features, such as the difficulty level, genre, etc.\n\nSecond, we will define a model or a set of guidelines to evaluate beatmap quality more objectively, at least for a certain subset of beatmaps, since chart evaluation is largely subjective and there are no universal guidelines to follow.\n\nThird, we will generalize the algorithm’s application field from one game to many since many rhythm games have different ways of creating beatmaps. We will do this by, for instance, applying weight sharing techniques to the model when training it on different datasets.\n\nLastly, we will find valuable training data for music annotation purposes which can, in turn, help in the development of new music-related tools and models going forward. \n\nBy the end of this study, we hope to demonstrate that it is possible to automate the creation of beatmaps, which can significantly reduce the workload of developers and players alike.",

        "response": "Apparatus \nThe experimental apparatus used in this study consisted of a personal computer(PC) equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti graphics card, HTC Vive Pro Eye head-mounted display(HMD), two Vive Trackers (one for the participant’s left foot and one for the right foot), the Unity game engine, and the Ready Player Me software. The Unity game engine was used to create the virtual environment and the interactive scenarios. The Ready Player me software was  used to generate virtual avatars.\nThe experiment was conducted in a soundproof room. The room was equipped with a personal computer(PC) that was used to collect questionnaire answers. During the experiment, participants stood in front of two Vive base stations in the room, and were instructed to wear the VR headset and trackers, which allowed for head and body movement tracking in the virtual environment.  \n\nAvatar set\nFor the experiment, a total of 144 avatars were generated, with 72 avatars for male participants and another 72 avatars for female participants. The generated avatars’ sex was matched to the participants’ sex to ensure that participants were presented with avatars that matched their own gender. The avatars were further divided into six different experimental conditions, with each condition consisting of 12 avatars. Specifically, for each condition, 4 avatars had red hair, 4 avatars had black hair, and 4 avatars  had gold hair, with different hairstyles for each avatar. In addition, 6 avatars within each condition had a comparatively darker skin color, while the remaining 6 had a comparatively lighter skin color. 12 avatars in the same condition wore the same clothing, and there were no duplicated avatars among the 144 total. (See appendix for the visual information.) \n\nParticipants\nParticipants were recruited within the KAIST community. 34 undergraduate and graduate students participated in the experiment (17 females, 17 males, mean age: 00, age SD = 0.00, age range: 00-00 years, 3 foreigners, 31 Koreans), all with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. All participants received 20,000won for their participation (duration: 60-90 min) \n\nProcedure\nPreparation\nOnce participants arrived, consent agreement documents were provided to obtain their signature. Subsequently, instructions regarding the experiment were given to the participants, and after ensuring their comprehension of the experiment procedure, they were escorted to the experiment room to don the HMD and trackers.\n\nEye calibration\nWhen the participant was ready to begin the experiment, an eye calibration process was performed. \n\nAvatar selection\nFollowing the eye calibration, a total of 12 avatars were presented to the participants in a grid format with 4 columns and 3 rows. Participants were then instructed to select an avatar as “My avatar”, while the researcher simultaneously selected an avatar as “Friend avatar”. Depending on the condition, participants either chose their own “My avatar” or it was chosen by the researcher. The hair color of the “Friend avatar” matched that of the participant’s “My avatar”, while their skin color differed from the “My avatar”.\n\nAvatar exposure\nAfter the avatar selection stage, “My avatar” and “Friend avatar” were sequentially presented in front of the participant for 3 seconds each. During this presentation, the avatar was rotated in a horizontal direction by 360 degrees, thereby enabling the participant to perceive the avatar’s distinguishing features from the back, side, and front of the avatar evenly. \n\nAvatar embodiment\nFollowing the avatar exposure, participants proceeded with the avatar embodiment process in which they were presented with a virtual mirror displaying “My avatar” and “Friend avatar”. Participants were then instructed to answer a series of questions regarding the mirror’s display of the avatars’ bodies and perform several movements, including clapping, touching their left shoulder with their right hand, and touching their friend avatar’s shoulder with their right hand. They were then asked to mimic the friend avatar’s pose and take a photo of themselves using the left-hand controller. The friend avatar posed in four different ways sequentially, with each pose involving lifting either the right arm, left arm, right foot, or left foot. Participants were asked to replicate each pose twice. The motion synchronization of “My avatar” with the participant was dependent on the condition, and could either be controlled by a button or remain still. The entire embodiment process was completed in an average of 3 minutes.\n   \nVisual search task\nNext, the participant completed a visual search task involving the identification of either “My avatar” or “Friend avatar” within a grid of 12 avatars presented in a 4x3 format. At the start of each trial, a pop-up window displaying the target avatar was presented, which participants were required to click to initiate the search task. Once the target image was clicked, the pop-up window closed, and the 12 avatars were presented. Participants were instructed to locate the target avatar as quickly as possible and click on it using their right hand controller. The participants complete 40 trials for each condition, in total 240 trials. \n\nData Collection \nDuring the visual search task, participants’ eye tracking data was collected as well as the reaction time and accuracy rate. After completing each condition, the participants were asked to answer the embodiment questionnaire with a PC in the experiment room. The standardized embodiment questionnaire utilized in this study was derived from Peck and Gonzalez-Franco’s (2021) research article titled “Avatar Embodiment: A Standardized Questionnaire” in Frontiers in Virtual Reality.  \n",

        "response": "Methodology \n\nVisual search task is a widely used experimental paradigm to study visual attention and perception in cognitive psychology[1,2,3]. During the visual search task, visual stimuli are presented with a display to participants and participants are asked to search for a specific target stimulus among distractors. In my experiment, the visual search task was manipulated using a within subject design to study whether the pop-out phenomenon applies for the self-avatar representation in virtual reality.\n\nApparatus \nThe experimental apparatus used in this study consisted of a personal computer(PC) equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti graphics card, HTC Vive Pro Eye head-mounted display(HMD), two Vive Trackers (one for the participant’s left foot and one for the right foot), the Unity game engine, and the Ready Player Me software. The Unity game engine was used to create the virtual environment and the interactive scenarios. The Ready Player me software was  used to generate virtual avatars.\nThe experiment was conducted in a soundproof room. The room was equipped with a personal computer(PC) that was used to collect questionnaire answers. During the experiment, participants stood in front of two Vive base stations in the room, and were instructed to wear the VR headset and trackers, which allowed for head and body movement tracking in the virtual environment.  \n\nAvatar set\nFor the experiment, a total of 144 avatars were generated, with 72 avatars for male participants and another 72 avatars for female participants. The generated avatars’ sex was matched to the participants’ sex to ensure that participants were presented with avatars that matched their own gender. The avatars were further divided into six different experimental conditions, with each condition consisting of 12 avatars. Specifically, for each condition, 4 avatars had red hair, 4 avatars had black hair, and 4 avatars  had gold hair, with different hairstyles for each avatar. In addition, 6 avatars within each condition had a comparatively darker skin color, while the remaining 6 had a comparatively lighter skin color. 12 avatars in the same condition wore the same clothing, and there were no duplicated avatars among the 144 total. (See appendix for the visual information.) \n\nParticipants\nParticipants were recruited within the KAIST community. 34 undergraduate and graduate students participated in the experiment (17 females, 17 males, mean age: 00, age SD = 0.00, age range: 00-00 years, 3 foreigners, 31 Koreans), all with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. All participants received 20,000won for their participation (duration: 60-90 min) \n\nProcedure\nPreparation\nOnce participants arrived, consent agreement documents were provided to obtain their signature. Subsequently, instructions regarding the experiment were given to the participants, and after ensuring their comprehension of the experiment procedure, they were escorted to the experiment room to don the HMD and trackers.\nEye calibration\nWhen the participant was ready to begin the experiment, an eye calibration process was performed. \nAvatar selection\nFollowing the eye calibration, a total of 12 avatars were presented to the participants in a grid format with 4 columns and 3 rows. Participants were then instructed to select an avatar as “My avatar”, while the researcher simultaneously selected an avatar as “Friend avatar”. Depending on the condition, participants either chose their own “My avatar” or it was chosen by the researcher. The hair color of the “Friend avatar” matched that of the participant’s “My avatar”, while their skin color differed from the “My avatar”.\nAvatar exposure\nAfter the avatar selection stage, “My avatar” and “Friend avatar” were sequentially presented in front of the participant for 3 seconds each. During this presentation, the avatar was rotated in a horizontal direction by 360 degrees, thereby enabling the participant to perceive the avatar’s distinguishing features from the back, side, and front of the avatar evenly. \nAvatar embodiment\nFollowing the avatar exposure, participants proceeded with the avatar embodiment process in which they were presented with a virtual mirror displaying “My avatar” and “Friend avatar”. Participants were then instructed to answer a series of questions regarding the mirror’s display of the avatars’ bodies and perform several movements, including clapping, touching their left shoulder with their right hand, and touching their friend avatar’s shoulder with their right hand. They were then asked to mimic the friend avatar’s pose and take a photo of themselves using the left-hand controller. The friend avatar posed in four different ways sequentially, with each pose involving lifting either the right arm, left arm, right foot, or left foot. Participants were asked to replicate each pose twice. The motion synchronization of “My avatar” with the participant was dependent on the condition, and could either be controlled by a button or remain still. The entire embodiment process was completed in an average of 3 minutes.\nVisual search task\nNext, the participant completed a visual search task involving the identification of either “My avatar” or “Friend avatar” within a grid of 12 avatars presented in a 4x3 format. At the start of each trial, a pop-up window displaying the target avatar was presented in the center of the participants’ view so that it could work as a fixation point. To initiate the search task, participants were required to click the pop-up window. Once the target image was clicked, the pop-up window closed, and the 12 avatars were presented. Participants were instructed to find the target avatar as quickly as possible and click on it using their right hand controller. The participants complete 40 trials for each condition, in total 240 trials. \n\nData Collection \nOne of the most common measures in visual search experiments is reaction time[1]. Therefore, during the visual search task, participants’ reaction time was collected as well as the eye tracking data and accuracy rate. After completing each condition, the participants were asked to answer the embodiment questionnaire with a PC in the experiment room. The standardized embodiment questionnaire utilized in this study was derived from Peck and Gonzalez-Franco’s (2021) research article titled “Avatar Embodiment: A Standardized Questionnaire” in Frontiers in Virtual Reality[4].  \n\n[1] Treisman, A.

F-value:  The F-value is the ratio of the variance between groups and the variance within groups, and it is calculated by the formula F = MSB / MSW, where MSB is the mean square for the between-groups effects and MSW is the mean square for the within-groups effects. The F-value indicates whether the difference between the groups is larger than what we might expect by chance.\n\n2. Degrees of freedom:  The degrees of freedom (df) represent the number of values in a statistical calculation that are free to vary. It is calculated as the number of groups minus one.\n\n3. p-value:  The probability value (p-value) is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis. It indicates the probability of obtaining a result as extreme as or more extreme than the observed result, if the null hypothesis is true.\n\n4. Partial Eta Squared:  Partial Eta squared (ηp²) is a measure of effect size that quantifies the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is accounted for by the independent variable after controlling for the effects of other independent variables. It ranges from 0 to 1 and can be interpreted as the percent of the variability in the dependent variable that is explained by the effect of the independent variable.\n\nSo, F(2.7, 98.74) = 8.51, p < .001, partial eta squared = .19 means that in this RMANOVA analysis, the main effect of the time variable is significant (F(2.7, 98.74) = 8.51, p < .001), indicating that the scores on the dependent variable are not equal across the levels of the time factor.

The values of the answer were aggregated with the formula provided by Gonzalez Franco and Peck, standardized questionnaire[1]. As a result, participants reported higher embodiment scores(M=000.SD=000) when the motion of ‘My avatar’ was synced with the participants’ movement.

In addition, all room attendants are not allowed to clean the different parts of the hotel room during the same day. Besides, there are three shifts, which are A-shift (00:00 to 08:00), B-shift (08:00 to 16:00), and C-shift (16:00 to 24:00), so there are total 10 kinds of duties including off-duty. They are A-shift & bathroom duty, A-shift & toilet duty, B-shift & bedroom duty, B-shift & bathroom duty, B-shift & toilet duty, C-shift & bedroom duty, C-shift & bathroom duty, C-shift & toilet duty, and off-duty. Meanwhile, the time required to clean each part of a room is different because of its size and spatial characteristics. Furthermore, because this paper considers several types of hotel rooms, the required time to clean the same part of a room is also different according to each type of hotel room. Therefore, the number of hotel rooms assigned to each room attendant should be determined considering the part of the hotel room and the type of hotel room. \nThe whole process is performed by two mathematical models. The goal of mathematical model 1 is to minimize the sum of the total workforce levels. In order to do this, the sum of workforce levels required for each shift should be minimized. Based on the results of mathematical model 1, mathematical model 2 determines how to distribute the duties to the room attendants considering the fairness and the welfare conditions in perspective of minimizing the number of room attendants. Through this process, the minimized number of required room attendants is determined. This paper assumes that all rooms are available, and the total number of rooms is equal to the sum of occupied rooms, clean rooms, and dirty rooms. In addition, it is assumed that a sufficient number of rooms are always pre-cleaned, so that no situation occurs where customer waiting occurs.\n\n2.2.2 Mathematical model 1: deriving minimum workforce level\nMathematical model 1 aims to minimize the sum of the total workforce levels required to each shift. The workforce level required for each shift is determined by the number of rooms required to be cleaned, taking into account the number of check-in, check-out rooms, and clean rooms. The derived workforce levels have to be enough to clean the number of rooms required for check-in demand during the whole scheduling period. The result of mathematical model 1 is the least amount of duties that must be assigned to the room attendants in mathematical model 2.\"\nIn the provided paragraph, what kind of elements can you find?",

Besides, there are three shifts, which are A-shift (00:00 to 08:00), B-shift (08:00 to 16:00), and C-shift (16:00 to 24:00), so there are total 10 kinds of duties including off-duty.

The samples were then covered with a seasoning called BBQ seasoning from National Pork Institute (NPI), an authoritative organization related to processed pork products. The samples were cut into 5 pieces according to the conventional method of subdividing the whole chicken for an equal distribution of heat in the oven. Subsequently the samples were placed on a stainless-steel plate which is known as a good heat conductor. The chicken-oven system was placed in the ovens and heated for 30 minutes.",

Therefore, the semicolon is used to join these two independent clauses that have a close relationship in meaning. \n\nOn the other hand, \"i) we needed to store the energy of four photons; and ii) we needed to design efficient catalysts\" is not an independent clause because it cannot stand alone as a sentence. It is a dependent clause that provides specific details about the two key roadblocks that had to be overcome.

We use \"at\" when referring to a specific place, for example: \"at the park\", \"at school\".\n\n3. \"The meats for the burgers: why for?\" : In this sentence, \"for\" is being used to indicate the purpose of the meat. In other words, the meat is being set aside specifically for use in the burgers. We use \"for\" before the purpose or goal of an action or object, for example: \"I bought flowers for my wife\", \"I exercise for my health\".\n\nDoes that help clear up your questions about prepositions?",

While \"in\" can also be used in some cases to express a specific date in relation to an event, it's generally used to indicate a larger time frame or duration. For example, you can say \"in May\" to refer to the entire month, or \"in the morning\" to mean the period of time between early hours and noon.\n\n3. \"In\" can also be used with certain prepositions to express different meanings, so if you tell me more about the context of the sentence, I could help you understand why \"for\" was used in the example you provided earlier.",

The reason why we don't use \"in\" in the phrase \"on the 15th of May 1940\" is because \"in\" generally refers to a larger time frame or duration, while \"on\" is used for a specific day or date. So in this case, \"on\" is used because we are referring to a specific date - the 15th of May.\n\n3. It's possible that \"in\" could also work in place of \"for\" in the sentence \"The meats in the burgers\", depending on the context. For example, if you were looking at a list of meats at a restaurant and the list was labeled \"Meats in the burgers\", that would make sense. However, using \"for\" in this case emphasizes that the meats are being set aside for a specific purpose, which is to be used in burgers.",

First, make sure you come to class prepared and ready to engage with the material. This means completing any assigned readings or homework ahead of time and coming to class with questions or comments about the material. \n\nSecond, actively listen to your classmates and the professor when they are speaking. This means giving them your full attention and taking notes if necessary. \n\nThird, don't be afraid to ask questions or share your thoughts and ideas with the class. Remember that everyone is there to learn and grow, and your contributions can help facilitate that process. \n\nFinally, try to be open-minded and respectful of others' opinions and perspectives. This will help create a positive and collaborative learning environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas. \n\nDoes that help?",

Start with a brief introduction that provides some context for the study. For example, you might mention that exercise is known to have a variety of physiological effects, including changes in hormone levels.\n\n2. Clearly state the research question or hypothesis that the study was designed to address. In this case, you might say something like, \"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship among exercise, norepinephrine, and growth hormone.\"\n\n3. Summarize the methods used in the study. For example, you might mention that the study involved a group of healthy adults who performed a standardized exercise protocol, and that blood samples were collected before and after the exercise.\n\n4. Provide a brief summary of the results. In this case, you might say something like, \"Our results showed that exercise was associated with significant increases in both norepinephrine and growth hormone levels.\"\n\n5. Conclude with a statement about the implications of the study. For example, you might say something like, \"These findings suggest that exercise may be an effective way to modulate hormone levels in healthy adults, which could have important implications for overall health and well-being.\"\n\nRemember to keep your abstract concise and focused, and to use clear and straightforward language.

In our class, we went over how to write the results section of a research paper using a three-part approach that includes explaining, comparing, and generalizing your findings. \n\nFirst, you want to **explain** your results by simply reporting what you found based on the data you collected. This involves presenting your results in an objective and straightforward manner, without interpretation or speculation.\n\nNext, you want to **compare** your results with other studies or relevant literature in your field. This allows you to contextualize your findings and demonstrate their significance. You may highlight similarities or differences between your results and those of other researchers.\n\nFinally, you want to **generalize** your results to broader populations, situations, or phenomena. This is where you can draw conclusions based on your results and discuss their implications for your field or for the world at large. However, be careful not to overstate your findings or make causal claims if they are not supported by your data.\n\nOverall, the result section should be presented with clarity and precision. Writing with this three-part approach can help you to write up your results clearly, and in a way that demonstrates their importance for your field.",

Visual aids can be very effective in helping to convey complex information in a way that is clear and easy to understand. Finally, it's important to write comments based on your analysis. This means using your own words to describe what you have learned from the survey responses, and providing context to help readers understand the significance of your findings.

        "response": "In order to use intermediate representation, two questions need to be answered: how to use it with feature output extracted from the backbone and how much it involves training the classifier. The following subsections describe two auxiliary branches that address the above requirements.\n\n2.1 Representation Summarization (RS)\nVision models learn to summarize input into a dense representation with downsampling operation. More specifically, linearly embedded token [24] or feature map [18, 14] shrinks with downsampling operation as channel size C increases. In order for the intermediate representation to be dense and informative enough, we adapt the perspective from Hu et al. [15], which views a feature map as a collective of local descriptors whose summarized statistics express input. Thus, the Representation Summarization (RS) module is composed of 2d pooling to reduce channel-wise statistics and MLP to learn inter-dependencies between channels. The representation transformed by the MLP layer is activated by sigmoid throughout all experiments, but any other activation function can be applied. The transformed representation is denoted by zˆl = MLP(Pool2d(zl)). (2) Note. For patch representation in works such as [24], the spatial dimension is already mixed in the patch merging step. Therefore, we directly flatten the representation and apply pooling 1d. zˆl = Pool1d(z ′ l )) (3) where z ′ l denotes flattened zl .\n\n2.2 Representation Mixup (RM)\nPrevious works either use representation extracted from Yim et al. [36] or use weights from layers of pre-trained models by simple averaging [34] or partial selection algorithm [10]. Along the line of this belief, intermediate representation can act as hints for capturing hard false negative samples with simple aggregation methods such as weighted sum or concatenation. The most straightforward method is to mix them in proper portion. We are inspired by several works on data augmentation using interpolation for mixing up in input space or feature space for better representation learning [39, 31]. An interpolation of hidden representations zi , zk with respect to zi is expressed as z ′ = zi + α(zk − zi) (4) where α denotes the scaling factor.\n\nGiven pre-trained backbone f, newly initialized linear classifier g, and input image x, the final output score s is s = g ◦ f(x). The final output representation from the pre-trained backbone is f(x) = zL. The pre-trained backbone can be expressed as two parts f(x) = f2 ◦ f1(x) and intermediate representation h can be retrieved while passing partial backbone f1. The final representation z ′ L passed to classifier g can be retrieved as follows: h = f1(x), hˆ = RS(h) ∈ R N , z′ L = hˆ · α + f2(h) · (1 − α) (5) . This means we mixup two elements: intermediate representation and final representation. \n\nIn this paper, following the recent works, we design a learninable parameter α by summarizing the hidden representation into a single value between 0 and 1 as α = σ(W · zL + b). (6) While previous mixup-based works [41, 13] use a beta distribution for α, here we use an auxiliary linear layer to learn the level of mix in an instance-wise manner.\n",

Below are some specific suggestions:\n\n- In the first sentence, it's not clear what you're referring to with \"it.\" Instead, rephrase the sentence to clarify what you're referring to.\n- In the paragraph on RS, it might be helpful to explain what downsampling means and why it's important for the representation to be dense and informative enough.\n- In the paragraph on RM, there are several long sentences that could be broken up to improve clarity. For example, the sentence \"Given pre-trained backbone f, newly initialized linear classifier g, and input image x, the final output score s is s = g ◦ f(x)\" could be split into two separate sentences.\n- In Equation (5), it might be helpful to define what N represents.\n- In Equation (6), it would be clearer if you provided some context for the σ symbol and what it represents.\n\nOverall, your paper is well-written and effectively communicates complex concepts. With some minor adjustments to clarity and grammar, it can be even more effective in conveying your ideas.",

With the emergence of advanced depth models, various methods have been developed to exploit pre-trained depth models at a large scale. However, for multi-label classification tasks, TL approaches often struggle to accurately predict multiple objects in an image with significant size differences. This is because such instances contain imperceptible objects that most pre-trained models lose the ability to detect during downsampling. To address this issue, this paper proposes a simple but effective classifier for multiple predictions that uses hidden representations from a fixed backbone. Specifically, we mix the pre-logit with the intermediate representation using a learnable scale. Our results show that our method is effective for fine-tuning with few additional parameters and is particularly advantageous for hard instances.",

Nearly 70% more adult A. gambiae were caught in communities near moist urban agricultural establishments than in rural locations or in locations without irrigated urban settlements. When we evaluated malaria episode report from people living in various parts of the city, we found that 18% of malaria cases in all seasons were reported by those near urban agricultural sites, whereas only 2% of the control groups reported incidences of malaria per year. \nVersion B:\nThe results of this study show that open-space irrigated vegetable fields in cities can provide suitable breeding sites for A. gambiae. This is reflected in higher numbers of adult A. gambiae in settlements in the vicinity of irrigated urban agricultural sites compared to control areas without irrigated urban agriculture. Moreover, people living in the vicinity of urban agricultural areas reported more malaria episodes than the control group in the rainy as well as dry seasons. Apparently, the informal irrigation sites of the urban agricultural locations create rural spots within the city of Kumasi in terms of potential Anopheles spp breeding sites. ",

One solution is using hydrogen as energy carrier, because hydrogen has a high energy density with weight, and it does not emit greenhouse gases at utilization. This has led to increased interest in the hydrogen supply chain, and several countries including Korea announce the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap [1]. In the hydrogen supply chain, because of the low efficiency of water electrolysis, most hydrogen is generated by reforming fossil fuels. Even though it still uses the fossil fuels as a hydrogen source, it has much higher efficiency than those using fossil fuels and emits high-density CO2, which can be more easily removed or utilized. However, hydrogen is highly explosive and it has gaseous form. To utilize hydrogen as an energy carrier, volumetric density and storage stability issues should be solved, so on-site reforming can be a solution.\nthis is original paragraph, can you check the grammar?\n",

As a solution to this issue, hydrogen has emerged as a potential energy carrier due to its high energy density with weight and zero greenhouse gas emissions at utilization. As a result, many countries, including Korea, have recently announced their Hydrogen Economy Roadmaps. However, the low efficiency of water electrolysis means that most hydrogen is still generated from reforming fossil fuels, although this method has a higher efficiency and emits high-density CO2 that can be more easily removed or utilized. Nevertheless, the highly explosive nature of hydrogen and storage stability remain key issues in the widespread utilization of hydrogen as an energy carrier, and to address these concerns, on-site reforming is a promising solution.",

Metal halide perovskites, particularly lead halide perovskites, are the most well-known material used for the synthesis of blue quantum dots.1 But because of the toxicity of lead, perovskites containing other types of metal are being emerged as an alternative to lead halide perovskites.2 Moreover, producing III-V type blue quantum dots using indium phosphide (InP) is also being studied.3 In this review, we will be discussing the properties of quantum dots synthesized with diverse materials, and compare the relative advantages and disadvantages of each type. Through this analysis, we will be able to assess the quantum dots whether they are suitable for use in light-emitting diode (LED) displays. The articles that could be discussed in this review were searched via Google Scholar. To focus on the quantum dot that consists the basis of QLEDs rather than the LED itself, we excluded the papers that contained insufficient information about the properties of quantum dots. Also, we narrowed the range of papers to less than 10 years after publication, since we will be discussing the recent advancements of blue quantum dots. Then, we selected one specific article from each basis material of quantum dots we will be dealing with: lead halide perovskites, lead-free halide perovskites, and InP. For the sake of credibility, we chose papers that were cited by other articles more than 50 times. After the whole process, we selected one paper that conducted studies about copper (II)-doped cesium lead halide perovskite quantum dots, one paper that did research on antimony halide perovskite quantum dots, and one paper that dealt with InP/ZnS/ZnS core/shell quantum dots.\nHere is it.

The largest portion that accounted for the students’ dissatisfaction was the limitation in choosing the menu, with 62.5% of students responding. What is intriguing is that from those who are unsatisfied with the cafeteria because of the limited menu, 80% were staying at KAIST for more than four years. This suggests that having similar meals for a long period of time may result in an adverse effect on the level of satisfaction of the cafeteria. Another major reason for students’ dissatisfaction towards the cafeteria at KAIST was because of the taste.

        "response": "The synthesis of blue quantum dots (QDs) has been studied with a variety of materials used. Blue quantum dots commonly have sizes of 2-6 nm and a peak wavelength of 400-500 nm. In order to have short wavelengths, these QDs are extremely small, so there exists difficulty in synthesizing them due to several factors such as Ostwald ripening, surface ligand effect, and quantum confinement effect. Depending on the precursors used, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of these quantum dots may also vary. PLQY is the ratio of the number of photons emitted through photoluminescence to the number of photons absorbed by the material, and is an important criterion for determining the efficiency of QDs. In this section, three recent studies regarding the synthesis of blue quantum dots will be presented. Along with the efficiency of the quantum dots, the struggle for minimizing the use of harmful elements is also being emphasized, so studies about CdSe quantum dots which contain hazardous cadmium will be excluded for this section.\nOne major example of blue quantum dot research is the use of indium and phosphorus precursors, resulting in indium phosphide (InP) QDs which are a type of III-V QDs. In 2020, Zhang et al.[1] reported the synthesis of blue InP quantum dots which have a structure of an InP core and a ZnS shell. For the core, (DMA)3P, ZnI2, and InI3 were used, while for the shell, zinc stearate and 1-dodecanethiol were used. The use of (DMA)3P is highly advantageous because it has high stability when exposed in the air and does not generate toxic PH3¬ gas. Since InP core by itself has low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), ZnS which has a large bandgap as a shell can enhance the PLQY up to 45%. The resulting quantum dots had an emission wavelength of 468 nm, which grants the QD to have a blue emission. What is striking in this study was that this wavelength of 468 nm was the shortest wavelength among the reported InP quantum dots at the time. Moreover, full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) was 47 nm, which is considered narrow among blue InP quantum dots.\nMeanwhile, other groups of researchers focused on the use of metal halide perovskites for the synthesis of blue QDs, owing to their high stability and excellent photophysical. In 2019, Bi et al.[2] reported that CsPb1-xCuxX3 (X = Br, Br/Cl) perovskite QDs have a potential for being used as blue QDs that possess great optical properties. CsPb1-xCuxX3 perovskite QDs are synthesized by doping Cu2+ ions to the CsPbX3 quantum dots. The larger Pb2+ ions are substituted with smaller Cu2+ ions, leading to a contraction of the octahedral structure and eventually a much more stable lattice. These blue quantum dots show an emission peak in the range of 450-460 nm, accompanied by a narrow PL linewidth. The PLQY was as high as 95% when the x value was 0.07. In particular, these doped quantum dots had high thermal stability due to the stability of the modified lattice structure. The CsPb0.93Cu0.07Br3 QDs retained their PLQY value to 35% under annealing temperatures of 250oC, while the undoped QDs showed a sharp decrease in their PLQY value to 1% at same temperatures. The superb optical properties and high thermal stabilities with the use of metal halide perovskites may pave the way for developing blue-emitting optoelectronic devices with improved stability.\nMetal halide perovskites surely account for a crucial part in the blue quantum dot synthesis study. However, the problem with these quantum dots is the fact that metal halide perovskites mostly consist of lead ions, which are notorious for toxicity to human bodies. To cope with this issue, a number of researchers aimed to reduce or even eliminate the lead part of these perovskites by substituting lead with other components. For instance, in 2017, Zhang et al.[3] reported the synthesis of blue quantum dots using lead-free Cs3Sb2Br9. These inorganic antimony halide perovskite quantum dots are synthesized via modifying the structure of traditional CsSbBr3 perovskites, by moving every third Sb layer along <111> direction. The QDs resulted in an emission peak of 410 nm, and the PLQY of 46% could be obtained. This value of PLQY was notable in that it was much higher than that of the counterparts with similar emission peaks. The high value of PLQY can be attributed to the higher proportion of Br that reduces the surface trapper effect, and a large exciton binding energy. In addition, the FWHM value was 41 nm, which is also a much improved value compared to previous studies.",

In each type of quantum dots, we have discussed the synthesis methods, the emission peak, the PLQY values, and the relative advantages of using the particular materials. InP, CsPb1-xCuxX3, and Cs3Sb2Br9 all showed an emission peak at 400-500 nm, and resulted in PLQY values over 40%.

Green OA is a type of open access where authors self-archive their work in an online repository, such as an institutional repository or a subject-specific repository. This means that the author can make their work available for free, but the final published version may not be available. Instead, the author can make a pre-print or post-print version of their work available, depending on the publisher's policies. \n\nA pre-print is the author's original manuscript before it has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication. A post-print is the author's manuscript after it has been peer-reviewed and revised, but before it has been formatted and copyedited by the publisher. \n\nGreen OA is a good option for authors who want to make their work open access but may not have the funds to pay for Gold OA. It also allows authors to retain some control over their work and make it available to a wider audience. However, it's important to note that not all publishers allow Green OA, so authors should check their publisher's policies before self-archiving their work.",

Fifty milliliters of cell culture were cross-linked with formaldehyde (final concentration of 1%) at room temperature for 15 minutes, and quenched with 2.5M glycine (final concentration of 125 mM) at room temperature for 5 minutes. The cells were washed with cold distilled water and flash-frozen for storage. Frozen cells can be stored indefinitely at -80°C and resuspended with 1 ml of spheroplast buffer containing 1 M sorbitol, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, and 10 mM beta-mercaptoethanol. Cell walls were digested with 400 units of Zymolyase (nacalai, 07765), for 15 minutes at 30°C with gentle shaking. Spheroplasted cells were then treated with 120 units of MNase for 25 minutes at 37°C without shaking. MNase digestion was stopped with EDTA and EGTA, each at a final concentration of 50 mM. RNA was digested with 0.3 mg/ml of RNase at 42°C for 1 hour. Samples were de-cross-linked with 1 mg/ml of proteinase K at 65°C with 1%SDS overnight. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and eluted with 30 µl of distilled water.\"",

Scientists study how this process works and have found that it involves many steps to make sure everything happens when it is needed. One of these steps involves how the DNA is arranged and organized. There are special proteins, called chromatin remodelers, which help to organize DNA. These proteins work by changing the shape of the proteins that wrap around the DNA, which then exposes different parts of the DNA to help control when genes are turned on or off.",

Here we report that the cohesin release factor WAPL creates a pool of free cohesin, in a process known as cohesin turnover, which reloads it to cell-type-specific binding sites. Paradoxically, stabilization of cohesin binding, following WAPL ablation, results in depletion of cohesin from these cell-type-specific regions, loss of gene expression and differentiation. Chromosome conformation capture experiments show that cohesin turnover is important for maintaining promoter–enhancer loops. Binding of cohesin to cell-type-specific sites is dependent on the pioneer transcription factors OCT4 (POU5F1) and SOX2, but not NANOG. We show the importance of cohesin turnover in controlling transcription and propose that a cycle of cohesin loading and off-loading, instead of static cohesin binding, mediates promoter and enhancer interactions critical for gene regulation.\" This paragraph is an abstract of a scientific paper.

A semicolon either joins two independent clauses (closely linked in thought) or separates complex items in a list. What is on the left side of the colon should stand alone as a separate sentence. Once the list ends, the sentence ends. A hyphen should be used to indicate that two or more words are acting as a single concept to describe the following noun. If the adjectives come after the noun, then they don’t need a hyphen. Hyphens can also be used while writing numbers like twenty-one. We don't need to use hyphens for prefixes, but prefixes re-, mid-, and ex- need to be used wirth hyphens. They can also be used to comment numbers and/or letters used as prefixed to a noun, such as T-cell; 10-cylinder; x-ray. And also to separate vowels or consonants that would otherwise merge together, such as pre-embryo; fall-like. I learnt that when using a series of hyphenated words that end with the same term, the end doesn’t have to be repeated. For example: The first-, second-, and third-order equations have all been solved. Hyphens are also used with prefixes that come before a word that needs a capital letter, like anti-American. Don’t use a hyphen when you have a compound modifier that consists of an adverb ending in -ly, for example: A highly respected scientist. And we should not stack modifiers. So we should not write it like \"Silica gel-coated glass-fiber paper chromatography\" we should write it like \"Chromatography on paper made from glass fibers and coated with silica gel\".\n\n\n\n",

Mice of both sexes aged P40-P120 were used for this study. Experiments were performed on wild type (WT, C57BL/6J n=[number]) male and female mice. Subjects were housed under light (starting at 8am) and dark (starting at 8 pm) cycle in single cages with food (mouse chow) available at will. Weight loss of no more than 10% of the initial weight was approved for experiments. \n\nDual Retrograde Tracing\nMice of age P50-90 were lightly anesthesized with isoflurane and set on a stereotaxic device (David Kopf Instruments). Throughout the surgery the mice were kept under 1.0-1.5% isoflurane in oxygen, and on a heating pad to maintain the body temperature. After ensuring proper anaesthesia through toe pinch reflex, the mice were head fixed with ear bars and eyes were covered in Vaseline to avoid dryness. The hair on the head was removed with hair removal cream, and the scalp was opened with a single cut down the middle. After removal of periosteum and cleaning of the skull (with ethanol and 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) the target areas were marked on the right hemisphere in reference to Bregma and Lambda. The coordinates used were AP +0.50 ML -0.20 DV -1.00 for ACC and AP -1.94 ML -.1.90 DV -0.40 for posterior parietal cortex (PPC), decided using Paxinos Atlas and Allen Brain Atlas (1, 2). Small craniotomies of 0.1 mm diameter were made over the target coordinates. Injections were done with Nanoliter injector (World Precision Instruments), 400 nl per area, both at 0.3 nl/sec speed. PPC was injected with pseudotyped AAV virus containing red fluorescence (PAAV-CAG-tdTomato), and ACC was injected with pseudotyped AAV virus containing green fluorescence (PAAV-CAG-tdTomato). Neurons projecting to PPC were expected to show red signals, and neurons projecting to ACC were expected to show green signals, while neurons projecting to both areas would be observed in yellow. After the injections the incision was close by suturing, and mice were sacrificed after 2 weeks for histology. \n\nHistology\nDual retrograde tracing mice were sacrificed after 2 weeks of virus incubation. The mice were anesthesized deeply with isoflurane and perfused with 1X PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were extracted from the skull and left for postfixation in 4% PFA either for 1 hour in room temperature (RT) or overnight in 4C. After fixation, brain samples were transferred into 30% sucrose in RT on a shaker for 2-3 days. After the brains sunk to the bottom of the tube, they were embedded into optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium (Tissue Tek) and stored at -80C freezer. Cryosectioning was performed at 30 nm thickness at the cryostat (Leica), from posterior areas to PPC to anterior areas to ACC, collecting one section and discarding the next. Sections were collected on microscope slides, washed in 1X PBS 3 times for 10 minutes each, and mounted in DAPI. Slides were imaged at the scanning microscope, in the channels DAPI, EGFP, and TdTomato.\nBehavioural experiment\n\nSurgery\nP40-60 mice were fixed at the stereotaxic device and kept at the same conditions as mentioned in the Dual Retrograde Tracing surgery. The scalp skin was cut and removed from between the eyes to the ears to expose the skull. Neck muscles were cut and removed. Skull was cleaned and PPC and ACC were marked. Headplates were attached to the skull with Loctite and dental cement. \n\nHead-fixed training\nHead-fixed training was performed to later test the mice in multisensory decision making. Training was done in soundproof chambers, fixed in a head-fixed tube apparatus. The mice were set in licking distance from a water port, a 7 inch gamma-corrected LCD monitor 10 cm away from the left eye (minimum & maximum luminance set as 1 & 120Lux), and a speaker 10 cm away from the left ear. In an attempt to provide a sound proof environment, the wooden chambers were covered with insulating foam on the inside. The mice were trained in a Go/No-Go task for auditory and visual modalities simultaneously. Black and white gradient horizontal/vertical drifting gratings were used for visual stimuli. 5 kHz and 10 kHz pure tones were used for auditory stimuli. Vertical left-to-right drifting gratings and 5 kHz pure tone were trained as Go stimuli and horizontal bottom-to-top drifting gratings and 10 kHz pure tone were trained as No-Go stimuli. The animals were water deprived for 2 days before the training. The first days were free-water period, where the mouse would get 4ul water reward with every lick, with no stimuli present. When the lick rate reached 200 licks/20 min, the mouse was advanced to conditioning period. In this period the mouse was given 1 ul water reward for Go trials regardless of lick response for the association of the stimuli to the reward. No punishment was present at this stage. When the Hit Rate ((Hit x 100)/(Hit+Miss)) reached 70%, the animal would be moved onto the training period. Training period consisted of hit, miss, false alarm and correct rejection according to the mouse’s licking the lick port within the response window after stimulus presentation. Hit trials were rewarded with 1 ul of water if mice licked within the response window. False Alarm trials were punished with a 200 ms airpuff. Miss and Correct rejection trials were neither rewarded nor punished. If animals did not get 1 ml water in total from training in a day, it was given the amount of water to complete the consumption to 1 ml after the training. The training was regarded complete when the Correct Rate (((Hit+Correct Rejection) x 100)/Number of Trials)) reached 80%. In the case of one modality reaching the treshold faster, the mouse was trained in single modality until they were on the same level. \nThere were going to be more subsections but I ran out of time I’m sorry:’)\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\tPaxinos G, J.

        "response": "In the previous years, a trend of students enrolled in undergraduate or higher degrees moving farther away for education has been observed. Although having a bigger radius for university selection increases the number of opportunities, students who have close relationships with their families may experience homesickness. Paying frequent visits to the family may alleviate this issue. Furthermore, visiting their family for students often ends up with the benefit of receiving more supplies such as homemade food. We have hypothesized that students who visit their family more often are on average happier, and conducted a survey consisting of four questions.\nBefore finding a relationship between the frequency of visiting family and happiness, we needed to check some factors which can affect the frequency. To this end, we first asked people about the distance they live from their families. Among our 16 respondents, the most frequent visitor was the person who lived the closest to their family (0-50km) with 16 visits on average within 4 months, while people living farther than 300km away showed the lowest results with two no visits and one 1 visit (Figure 1). However, between 100-200km, no significant trend was observed. We then questioned whether the closeness of the relationship between the respondents and their families affected the number of visits. As can be seen in Figure 1, no correlation was observed. Three people reported their closeness to their family as a 7 on a scale of 0 to 10. While one of them visited 16 times in the given period, the other two remained at the low numbers of 1 and 2. This could be attributed to the distance factor, as the respondent visiting their family 16 times lives the closest to their home at 0-50km; however, two people living in the same distance interval (100-200km) reported their closeness level as 8 and visited home 8 and 1 times. Overall, it can be observed in Figure 1 that at the closest and farthest ends of the scale (0-50km & 300km) distance plays a significant role in the frequency of home visits, while it shows variety in the middle range (100-200km). Emotional closeness, on the other hand, does not seem to factor into the results. \n\nLastly, we compared the frequency of visiting family with perceived level of happiness to test our hypothesis (Figure 2). No correlation was observed between the two factors. While respondent 1 with an average of 16 home visits in 4 months reported 4 on their level of happiness, respondent 15 scored the highest score, 10, on the happiness chart and did not visit their family at all. However, no inverse correlation was observed, as respondents with high responses on both questions (see respondent 3) and low responses on both questions (see respondent 7) were also present. Overall, our data has shown that there is no direct correlation between students’ level of happiness and their amount of home visits.\n",

        "response": "Yes, I recall covering how to write with numbers in our class this week. I understand that there are no standard rules, but rather there are different rules that can vary widely. For instance, it is recommended to use numerals for numbers greater than nine, but spell out numbers between one and nine. It is important to check a template, style guide, or relevant journal for specific style requirements. Having consistency in writing is key. There are many exceptions to these rules, and for specific cases such as page numbers (page 2), figure numbers (Figure 2), negative numbers (-1), decimals (0.3), specific measurements (12 meters/seconds), percentages (15 percent or 15%), and monetary figures ($4,350) there may be unique guidance. It is also recommended to avoid starting sentences with numerals, and if one number is presented as a numeral, it is best to represent all others in the same way (keep consistency). Furthermore, when two numbers are next to each other, it is suggested to write one out and use a numeral for the other. Good job summarizing what you learned about how to write with numbers.

        "response": "RESULTS\nData obtained in a previous study by Song et al. indicated that Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC) is involved in multisensory integration of audiovisual stimuli in mice performing a head-fixed discrimination task, modulating auditory dominance (1). Furthermore, anatomical tracing experiments in mice demonstrated that auditory cortex (AC) and visual cortex (VC) are connected not only to PPC, but also anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (2). We performed dual retrograde tracing to examine this anatomical connectivity, and chemical deactivation of ACC and PPC in head-fixed trained mice performing an audiovisual Go/No-Go discrimination task (see Methods).\n           \tDual-retrograde tracing (Figure 1a) has shown that VC projects onto both association areas. As can be seen on Figure 1b, these projections were found to be from segregated neuron populations. Red and green signals were clearly observed in segregated groups in the primary visual cortex (V1), no convergent yellow signal being observed. ACC also received projections from secondary visual areas (V2L, V2M). It is evident that the projections from VC to PPC and ACC are not of the same origin. Furthermore, robust AC projections to ACC were not observed. The signal in AC was mainly red and concentrated in the auditory dorsal (AuD) area, showing projections from AC to PPC. The volume of retrograde virus injection in ACC may have been a bit more in volume than optimal; however, as the injection center appears to be in the correct target (cingulate cortex area 1; Cg1), this should not have created a significant deviation on the results (Figure 1c). The injection in PPC seemed to be confined within the borders of the area according to Paxinos Atlas (3) (Figure 1d).\n\nChemical deactivation of ACC, and training and testing stimuli were shown on Figure 2a, b. Muscimol injection on ACC has not shown any significant change in the correct rates in the audiovisual Go/No-Go test compared to the control injection of PBS (Figure 2c, d). However, the results can be less than ideal, as the correct rates for both modalities are below the trained 80% in both animals. Although the task training period was finished at a correct rate of over 80% for both auditory and visual stimuli, the results are suboptimal for both in the testing condition. For example, as can be seen on Figure 2d, Mouse F#2 has shown 51.6 and 58.6% visual correct rates for muscimol and PBS injections respectively, which is drastically low compared to the trained 80% threshold. Furthermore, the muscimol injection trials seem to have lower visual correct rates for both mice, which was not expected. These may have been caused by the unpredicted stress the injection surgery put on the animals on the day of testing. \n\nOverall, ACC seems to be anatomically connected to VC, through a segregated population of neurons when compared to PPC. ACC does not seem to modulate decision making in audiovisual conflict resolution task, at least in our specific head-fixed task paradigm. However, the testing conditions were not optimal, which makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions from the current data.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\tSong Y-H, Kim J-H, Jeong H-W, Choi I, Jeong D, Kim K, et al.

CDP collected data about the CEO’s responsibilities, board positions, and carbon emissions from over 4000 companies from several countries. The details about the CEO education attributes not included in the CDP database are collected from public sources, including companies' annual reports or LinkedIn profiles.\nSurvey Structure\nThe companies were asked to fill out a form with questions about their carbon emissions, governance structure, and the CEO’s responsibility.\nFor the governance structure, companies were asked to provide details about the department supervising the ESG-related matters, whether it is a specific board or an executive member. This data helps us control the influence of other executive members on CEO decisions.\nAs for the CEO’s responsibility, the questionnaire included inquiries about the CEO’s role in ESG-related matters and whether they are directly or indirectly reported to him.\nRegarding carbon emissions, the companies were asked to report their yearly emissions number and indicate their level of engagement in reducing them. This data helps measure the dependent variable of our model.\nThe CDP database did not include details about the CEO education attributes our study focuses on. Therefore, we had to collect them individually through publicly available sources. We quantified whether the CEO studied abroad and the presence or absence of ESG awareness in their educational background. This helps us measure the independent variable of our study.\n",

This would help readers understand why these sources are appropriate for your study and how the data you collected from them will be useful for your analysis.\n\n2. Data Collection: It would be helpful to further explain the process of how you collected and analyzed the data. For example, were the surveys sent to all the companies in the CDP database, or were they randomly selected? How did you decide which companies to include in your sample? Additionally, how did you manage missing data and ensure the accuracy of the data collected?\n\n3. Limitations: It's important to acknowledge any limitations of your study. For example, are there any potential biases in the CDP database or public sources that could affect the validity of your findings? Are there any other variables that you were unable to control for in your analysis? Acknowledging limitations can help readers understand the strengths and weaknesses of your study.\n\nOverall, your paragraph provides a good start to your methodology section.

If you're interested in learning more about different methods for analyzing data related to sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR), you might find a book like \"Research Methods in Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility: An Introduction\" by Kimmarie McGoldrick and David S. Rindova to be helpful.\n\n3. Other articles that have explored similar research questions and used similar methods could also be useful resources. For example, a recent article by Diao et al.

Industry reports or publications on corporate sustainability and CSR practices could also be helpful in providing context and background information on the topic.\n\nI hope this helps you find some relevant resources for your research project!",

Here's an example of what a results section could look like with explanations for each paragraph:\n\nParagraph 1: Overview of the Results\nIn this paragraph, you would give a brief, high-level overview of what the data shows. Start with a few sentences that describe the purpose of the study and what data was gathered. Then, provide a summary of the main results you found. This paragraph should be well-crafted and clear so that readers can quickly understand what you found.\n\nParagraph 2: Description of the Data Collected\nIn this paragraph, you would provide more detail about the data you collected, explaining the source and nature of the data. For instance, if you conducted a survey, you might discuss how many participants were involved, where they were from, and other relevant information. If you conducted experiments, you could explain the experimental design, the procedures used, and how the data was collected.\n\nParagraph 3: Clarity\nThe clarity paragraph should focus on making sure that the results are written clearly and unambiguously. In this paragraph, you might describe how you analyzed the data and what statistical tests you performed. You would also explain the results of those tests and provide information about what they mean. Ensure that any technical terms or jargon is explained clearly and concisely for readers to understand.\n\nParagraph 4: Interpretation\nThe interpretation of results is important as it involves explaining your findings and what they mean in a broader context. In this paragraph, you would discuss the implications of your findings and their relevance to your study's overall aims and objectives. Here, you should demonstrate your understanding of the data and give nuanced interpretations.\n\nParagraph 5: Visuals Referred to in the Text\nHere, you should ensure all visuals are referenced in the text. This could include graphs, charts, and tables presenting the data. The paragraph should provide descriptions of any visuals presented in your scientific writing with clarity and detail. Each visual should be introduced in the text with precise explanations that enable the reader to understand the relationship between the visual and the overall written text.\n\nParagraph 6: Visuals\nIn this final paragraph, you should provide clear and accurate visuals of your data. Make sure that any figures are presented with appropriate labels and scales, and that it's clear where they fit into the overall presentation. The visuals should be well-positioned and easy to read. Each figure should contain a legend that provides a complete sentence summarizing the experimental results and basic information.\n\nRemember, these are just examples. Your results section might include a different number of paragraphs or focus on different types of data. The important thing is to make sure every paragraph you write is well-structured with a clear purpose that aligns with the rubric criteria.",

        "response": "In research writing, you should use active voice whenever possible. The following are some instances where passive voice is more appropriate:\n\n1. Emphasizing the object, not the subject:\nUse passive voice when you want to emphasize what was done to something, rather than who did it. This is often the case in Methods sections of a research paper, where the focus is on the experimental techniques themselves, rather than on who performed them. For example, \"Samples were analyzed using mass spectroscopy\" emphasizes the technique used, while \"We analyzed the samples using mass spectroscopy\" emphasizes who performed the analysis.\n\n2. Concealing the doer:\nUse passive voice when the doer is unknown, irrelevant, or obvious. For example, \"It was reported that the incidence of the disease had increased\" conceals the doer, while \"Smith et al. (2018) reported that the incidence of the disease had increased\" specifies the authors who reported the findings.\n\n3. Avoiding personal pronouns:\nPassive voice can also be used to avoid excessive use of personal pronouns (I, we, you, etc.) In scientific writing, it is generally preferred to minimize the use of personal pronouns in order to maintain an objective tone.\n\nHowever, in general, active voice is preferred in scientific writing, as it is more concise, direct, and helps to clarify the relationship between the subject and the action. Active voice is particularly important in the Results and Discussion sections, where the emphasis is on the findings and their interpretation.",

        "response": "Here are some general guidelines for choosing between active and passive voice based on the tense used:\n\n1. Present Simple: This tense is often used in the Methods section to describe experiments, procedures or techniques. Generally, active voice is preferred. For example, \"The researchers placed the test tubes in a water bath\" is better than \"The test tubes were placed in a water bath by the researchers.\"\n\n2. Simple Past: Passive voice is sometimes used in this tense to describe completed actions, particularly in the Results section, for example, \"The samples were collected for analysis.\" However, active voice can be used if the emphasis is on who performed the action, for example, \"We collected the samples for analysis.\"\n\n3. Present Perfect and Past Perfect: Passive voice may be used in these tenses to describe actions that have already been performed and whose results are currently evident. For example, \"The experiment has been conducted several times\" or \"The data had already been analyzed before the new findings were discovered.\" However, this is not always the case, and active voice can also be used to describe the same actions.\n\n4. Future and Modal: In the case of these tenses, the choice between active and passive voice is usually determined by the intended emphasis (e.g., the action or the object) and clarity of the sentence. For instance, \"We will conduct further studies\" and \"Further studies will be conducted\" both convey the same meaning, but the former emphasizes the actor, while the latter emphasizes the action.\n\nIn general, the choice between active and passive voice depends on the context of the sentence, the intended emphasis, and the desired clarity of communication.",

        "response": "Method\n\n Porous carbon material derived from carbon dioxide as the reference material for identifying the active site of boron for 2 electron reduction, which is doped with heteroatoms (Boron, Oxygen). As this porous carbon material contains boron and oxygen, which are simultaneously generated when NaBH4 is used as a reducing agent, it would be a suitable reference. To further dope the carbon material with additional oxygen, we used a polymer containing O. The polymer and carbon material were heat-treated together, the polymer would decompose into fragments and oxygen could be doped into the carbon material. To efficiently confirm the effect of oxygen doping, we selected a similar structure polymer without oxygen as the compare group.\n\n\n\n1.     Synthesis of carbon materials by converting CO2\n\n To obtain carbon materials by converting CO2, reducing agent, NaBH4 (Sigma-Aldrich, >99%), was prepared. Placed 2g of NaBH4 in an alumina boat and put in a furnace, raising the temperature to 520°C at a rate of 5°C/min. To prevent the reaction, we flowed inert gas, Ar, at a rate of 55 sccm. When the temperature reached 500°C, replaced Ar with CO2 as a carbon source and maintained the same flow rate of 55 sccm. We maintained the temperature at 500°C for 2 hours for sufficient reaction between CO2 and NaBH4. After waiting for the temperature to cool down, the carbon material was obtained. To remove impurities, washed the obtained carbon material with a 5M HCl solution by stirring at 80°C for 30 minutes and conducting filtration twice. Next, stirred the material in distilled water at 80°C for 30 minutes and filtered it three times. Finally, converted the material to a neutral condition by treating it with an ethanol solution twice. After washing, dried the material at 80°C overnight and obtained the basic carbon material, Boron doped porous carbon (BPC).\n\n\n\n2.     Heat treatment of carbon materials with oxygen-containing polymers\n\n\n Carbon material obtained from carbon dioxide was modified by conducting thermal treatment with a polymer, polyethylene oxide (PEO, Sigma-Aldrich), which contains oxygen for additional doping. The mixture of the carbon material, BPC, and PEO was prepared in a 1:4 mass ratio (0.1g:0.4g) by mixing with a vortex mixer for 5 minutes to ensure proper mixing. The mixture was then placed in an alumina boat and heated in a furnace with argon gas flowing at a 55sccm and heat rate of 5℃/min up to a temperature of 500°C, which was maintained for 3 hours after reached 500°C. Afterward, the temperature was gradually cooled lowered to room temperature to obtain the material BPC_PEO, which was the result of the thermal treatment of BPC and PEO. The obtained material was subjected to a washing and drying process, which involved placing it in a 5M HCl solution and stirring it for 30 minutes at 80°C, followed by filtration once. Then, the material was stirred in distilled water at 80°C for 30 minutes and filtered twice. Finally, to neutralize the carbon material, the same process was repeated with an ethanol solution once. The washed material was then dried overnight at 80°C and subjected to additional heat treatment to obtain the final carbon material, BPC_PEO.\n\n\n\n3.     Heat treatment of carbon materials with non oxygen-containing polymers\n\n To prepare a comparison group for carbon materials doped with oxygen, a polymer Polyethylene (PE, Sigma-Aldrich) and the basic carbon material BPC with the same structure with PEO but non oxygen polymer were processed together. The process of obtaining the materials including thermal treatment was the same as the previous process. BPC and PE were mixed in a 1:4 ratio (0.1g:0.4g) using a vortex mixer for 5 minutes to ensure proper mixing. The mixture was then placed in an alumina boat and put into a furnace. Argon gas was flowed through the furnace, and the temperature was raised to 500°C at a rate of 5℃/min. When the temperature reached 500°C, it was maintained for 3 hours before being lowered to room temperature to obtain the material BPC_PE, where BPC and PE were co-processed. The obtained material underwent a cleaning process and drying process as follows: it was placed in a 5M HCl solution and stirred at 80 °C for 30 minutes before being filtered once. Then, it was stirred in distilled water at 80 °C for 30 minutes and filtered twice. Finally, to neutralize the carbon material, the solution was converted to an ethanol solution and the same process was repeated once. After washing, the material was dried overnight at 80 °C to obtain the final carbon material, BPC_PE, which was subjected to additional heat treatment.\n\n\n\n4.     Electrochemical experiment\n\n\n\nThe catalytic ability of the materials in producing hydrogen peroxide was measured using Rotating Ring Disk Electrode (RRDE) in a three-electrode cell. Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode, and Pt coil electrode was used as the counter electrode and RRDE electrode. Solution consisting of 1 ml ethanol, 0.1 ml 5 wt% Nafion, and 4 mg catalyst was sonicated for 1 hour to disperse the catalyst well, and then 5 ul was dropped to load the catalyst. The electrode with the solution was rotated at 600 rpm for 30 minutes to dry and fix the catalyst on the electrode. LSV(Linear Sweep Voltammetry) measurements were then conducted underusing KOH 0.1M and Na2SO4 0.1M solutions as an electrolyte at a scan rate of 10 mV/s to test the performance of the catalyst with rotating 1600rpm. The actual current resulting from oxygen reduction was calculated as the difference between measurements taken in an argon-saturated solution initially and an oxygen-saturated solution subsequently.\n\nhere",

It seems like a well-written summary of the methodology you used for your research on identifying the active site of boron for 2 electron reduction. However, there are a few minor issues that I'd like to point out:\n\n1. Although the first paragraph provides some context for your research, it might be helpful to include a sentence or two at the beginning or end of the paragraph to explain why you are conducting this research or the significance of this topic.\n\n2. In the first paragraph, when you say \"To further dope the carbon material with additional oxygen, we used a polymer containing O,\" it would be clearer if you added what the \"O\" stands for, such as \"oxygen.\"\n\n3. In the second paragraph, when discussing the heat treatment process, you use the word \"lowered\" instead of \"lowering.\" The sentence would read more clearly as \"Afterward*,* the temperature was gradually lowered to room temperature to obtain the material BPC_PEO.\"\n\nOverall, your summary provides a clear and concise methodology that you used for your research. It's great to see that you have explained how you synthesized your carbon materials and how you conducted your electrochemical experiments. Well done!",

We first explored the role of economic resources in changing couple’s division of housework in the course of marriage (Table 1). We investigate the impact of the spouse’s relative economic resources on the likelihood of dividing housework either more equally or less equally in the course of marriage. We find that husbands who work a similar number of hours (Husband = Wife), or lower number of hours (Husband < Wife) than their wives, are less likely to decrease their share in household labor, compared to husbands who work longer hours than their wives (Husband > Wife). Equal earning levels between the spouses also seem to reduce the likelihood for husbands to decrease their share of housework in the course of marriage (model 3b). For couples with an “atypical” female provider earnings ratio (Husband < Wife) the effect is not significant, however. It appears that a winning margin in economic resources does more for the husband than for the wife when housework is redistributed. \n\tWe also looked at the effects of family formation on the gender division of household tasks to assess how shifts in economic resources play in this context (Table 2). We found a pronounced and significant effect for both directions of change. During the first year after childbirth, fathers seem to be about twice as likely to decrease their contribution to housework. In the same period, fathers’ likelihood to increase their share in housework is reduced by almost 50 percent, compared to childless men. \n\tThis push towards a more traditional division of housework seems to come to a halt when the youngest child reaches age two. We found no indication, however, that parents readjust back to a more egalitarian division of housework when kids grow older and mothers return to their previous jobs. The time-varying economic indicators (models 2ab and 3ab) do not seem to explain these processes at all. Here, we need to be cautious not to interpret lack of significance in the economic indicators as lack of relevance, especially since the share of parents in the “non-traditional” resource categories is low. The number of mothers out-earning or working longer hours than their husbands is small in this sample, and the share of continuously working mothers is low. \" in terms of removal of the four common problems?",

In addition, bathing may reduce one’s risk by up to 57%, and the use of insect repellent may be protective against the disease up to 75%. \n\n Our results suggest that the part of the bindin responsible for species-specific eff agglutination lies in the region of residues 75-121. We showed that residues 18-74 and 122-136 can be deleted without loss of egg agglutination activity. All of the biologically active bindin deletion analogs were found to be species-specific by their ability to agglutinate exclusively S. purpuratus eggs. Deletion analogs that had any residues of region 75-121 deleted exhibited no significant activity above the bacterial control protein. \n\n We observed virtually no size classes of mtDNA molecules. Since the undegraded circular mtDNA molecules were entirely of heterogeneous size, this obser ed size heterogeneity probably reflects the real situation within plant mitochondria…In contrast to our observations, size classes of linear or circular molecules and species specific differences have been previously reported (24, 25). However, these studies were performed only with a fraction of supercoiled DNA (26), which most likely does not represent the complete set of molecules existing in organelle. Supercoiled DNA isolated from a C. album suspension culture, for example, consisted exclusively of small circular plasmid mp1 DNA. Its oligomers were found in the open circular form, thus appearing indeed as a few size classes. \n\n We have shown that annual canine vaccination campaigns achieving 67% coverage in Ngorongoro and 42% coverage in Serengeti should be sufficient to control rabies outbreaks with 95% confidence. These coverage levels are lower than the WHO-recommended annual target of 70% (26). We focused on annual coverage targets, since rabies vaccination in Tanzania is conducted through annual campaigns and since the WHO target is specified as such. However, we also calculated that 39% and 25% coverage consistently maintained in Ngorongoro and Serengeti, respectively, will control rabies outbreaks with 95% confidence. These estimates of required coverage are much lower than previous recommendations of 70% coverage on a consistent basis (1).

Could you revise my paragraph \" Our findings emphasize the need to continue to promote personal protection measures to reduce the risk of Lyme disease infection. We have identified three reasonable personal measures that may be protective against Lyme disease when practiced: tick checks, bathing, and insect repellents. Performing tick checks within 36 hr after spending time in the yard may reduce one’s risk by as much as 46%. In addition, bathing may reduce one’s risk by up to 57%, and the use of insect repellent may be protective against the disease up to 75%. \n\n Our results suggest that the part of the bindin responsible for species-specific eff agglutination lies in the region of residues 75-121. We showed that residues 18-74 and 122-136 can be deleted without loss of egg agglutination activity. All of the biologically active bindin deletion analogs were found to be species-specific by their ability to agglutinate exclusively S. purpuratus eggs. Deletion analogs that had any residues of region 75-121 deleted exhibited no significant activity above the bacterial control protein. \n\n We observed virtually no size classes of mtDNA molecules. Since the undegraded circular mtDNA molecules were entirely of heterogeneous size, this obser ed size heterogeneity probably reflects the real situation within plant mitochondria…In contrast to our observations, size classes of linear or circular molecules and species specific differences have been previously reported (24, 25). However, these studies were performed only with a fraction of supercoiled DNA (26), which most likely does not represent the complete set of molecules existing in organelle. Supercoiled DNA isolated from a C. album suspension culture, for example, consisted exclusively of small circular plasmid mp1 DNA. Its oligomers were found in the open circular form, thus appearing indeed as a few size classes. \n\n We have shown that annual canine vaccination campaigns achieving 67% coverage in Ngorongoro and 42% coverage in Serengeti should be sufficient to control rabies outbreaks with 95% confidence. These coverage levels are lower than the WHO-recommended annual target of 70% (26). We focused on annual coverage targets, since rabies vaccination in Tanzania is conducted through annual campaigns and since the WHO target is specified as such. However, we also calculated that 39% and 25% coverage consistently maintained in Ngorongoro and Serengeti, respectively, will control rabies outbreaks with 95% confidence. These estimates of required coverage are much lower than previous recommendations of 70% coverage on a consistent basis (1). The difference is possibly due to the fact that the parameters of the previous study were drawn from Asia and the Americas, whereas our model considers rabies dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa (19).\" in terms of the writing guideliens?",

We have identified three effective personal measures that may reduce the likelihood of Lyme disease when practiced: tick checks, bathing, and insect repellents. Performing tick checks within 36 hours of outdoor exposure can reduce the risk of infection by up to 46%. Bathing after outdoor activities and using insect repellent can reduce the risk of infection by up to 57% and 75%, respectively.\n\nSecond Paragraph:\nOur results suggest that the region of residues 75-121 in the bindin protein is responsible for species-specific eff agglutination activity. We demonstrated that removing residues 18-74 and 122-136 does not impact egg agglutination activity. All of the biologically active bindin deletion analogs we tested were species-specific and aggregated only S. purpuratus eggs. Notably, we observed that deletion analogs with residues of region 75-121 removed lacked significant activity compared to the bacterial control protein. These findings are important for developing strategies to disrupt bindin activity to prevent fertilization.\n\nThird Paragraph:\nWe observed little size heterogeneity in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules we examined. While the circular mtDNA molecules we analyzed were all of heterogeneous size due to degradation, we believe our observations accurately depict the size heterogeneity that exists within plant mitochondria. In contrast, previous studies have reported size classes of linear or circular mtDNA molecules and species-specific differences. However, these studies were conducted only on a fraction of supercoiled DNA, which likely does not represent the complete set of molecules in the organelle. For instance, supercoiled DNA isolated from a C. album suspension culture consisted exclusively of small circular plasmid mp1 DNA, which appeared in open circular form, thus appearing as a few size classes.\n\nFourth Paragraph:\nOur study provides valuable insights for rabies control efforts specific to sub-Saharan Africa. Our results indicate that annual canine vaccination campaigns achieving 67% coverage in Ngorongoro and 42% coverage in Serengeti can effectively prevent rabies outbreaks with 95% confidence. Although these coverage levels are lower than the WHO-recommended annual target of 70%, our analysis focused on annual coverage targets, which are consistent with the way rabies vaccination campaigns are conducted in Tanzania and the WHO mandate. Additionally, we found that consistently maintaining 39% and 25% vaccination coverage in Ngorongoro and Serengeti can still contribute to controlling rabies outbreaks with 95% confidence. Our estimates of required coverage are lower than previous recommendations of achieving 70% coverage on a consistent basis, possibly as a result of parameters used in previous studies being drawn from Asia and the Americas, rather than from the rabies dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa that we considered in our study.",

For these six elements,  does my paragraph \"Many insects possess a sexual communication system that is vulnerable to chemical espionage by parasitic wasps. We recently discovered that a hitch-hiking (H) egg parasitoid exploits the antiaphrodisiac pheromone benzyl cyanide (BC) of the Large Cabbage White butterfly Pieris brassicae. This pheromone is passed from male butterflies to females during mating to render them less attractive to conspecific males. When the tiny parasitic wasp Trochogramma brassicae detects the antiaphrodisiac, it rides on a mated female butterfly to a host plant and then parasitizes her freshly laid eggs. The present study demonstrates that a closely related generalist wasp, Trichogramma evanescens, exploits BC in a similar way, but only after learning. Interestingly, the wasp learns to associate an H response to the odors of a mater femalr P. brassicae butterfly with reinforcement by parasitizing freshly laid butterfly effs. Behavioral assays, before which we specifically inhibited long-term memory (LTM) formation with a translation inhibitor, reveal that the wasp has formed protein synthesis-dependent LTM at 24 h after learning. To our knowledge, the combination of associatively learning to exploit the sexual communication system of a host and the formation of protein synthesis-dependent LTM after a single learning event has not been documented before. We expect it to be widespread in nature, because it is highly adaptive in many species of egg parasitoids.

Specifically, we would image the target using two cameras from two different angles, with the projector projecting multiple patterns onto the target. The patterns would create a unique texture on the target’s surface, which can then be used to locate corresponding pairs of points from the observed images. This is because when the pattern is projected onto the surface of the target, its shape is distorted in a unique way that depends on the surface shape, which can be used to calculate the depth of different points. By analyzing the distortion of the patterns in the two images, we can accurately calculate the depth of each point on the surface of the target and from this information, we can find the corresponding points pairs to perform 3D reconstruction.",

According to the review of the literature, there have been considerable growths in sub-THz transceiver technology over the past ten years [2], notably in the advancement of new materials, circuit design techniques, and system architectures.\nHowever, the scarcity of components, particularly at frequencies exceeding 200 GHz, is one of the major issues in sub-THz communication systems. Nevertheless, recent developments in fabrication methods and nanoscale materials have resulted in the invention of new components, including transistors, and diodes operating in the sub-THz frequency range [2]. Therefore, these components have made it possible to create various sub-THz integrated transceiver sub-blocks, for example, amplifiers, mixers, and oscillators [3] in order to create overall sub-THz communication systems with higher data rates and lower power consumption than possible before.\nAnother challenge in sub-THz integrated transceiver design is the high power consumption of the transceivers, which is caused by the significantly high frequency and bandwidth of sub-THz signals. Currently, recent developments in integrated power management techniques, such as dynamic voltage scaling and power amplifier linearization particularly for the transmitters, that account for the major power loss in the whole communication system, and new circuit design techniques [3] have enabled the design of low-power sub-THz transceivers.\n\nPlease give me summarize more\n",

Our results did not support H.1. No significant difference was found for primary task performance among the three interfaces. We surmise that HG and GS were not advantageous compared to EG due to the characteristics of the primary walking task we chose. To keep an ideal distance, participants needed to pay attention to the back of the virtual human, leading to a primary focus on the forward direction and the central vision. This means that unobtrusiveness was not a major issue because there were no awareness needs in the periphery, so the unobtrusiveness advantages of HG and GS were not reflected in task performance. In contrast, looking away from the forward direction/central vision, as required by HG and, to a lesser extent, GS, could diminish performance on the distance-keeping task. This is also supported by the fact that HG users were more likely to lose track of the virtual human after answering a question, because they needed to look away from the virtual human to acquire information. In addition, all participants obtained relatively low distance scores in the three conditions, and all but two avoided all the obstacles. This indicates that the primary task was relatively easy to perform, even while performing secondary tasks at the same time. Thus, potential disadvantages of the EG interface may not have surfaced during this primary task.\n\nplease make summary\n",

To reduce the effect of coupling and crosstalk in capacitive-based touch sensors, one approach is to use shielding techniques. Shielding involves placing a conductive material around the sensor to block external electric fields from interfering with the sensor's signal. For example, a capacitive touch sensor in a smartphone can be shielded by a metal frame around the screen. This metal frame acts as a shield to block external electric fields from interfering with the sensor's signal. Another approach is to use differential sensing, where two sensors are used to measure the difference in capacitance between them. This helps to cancel out any common-mode noise or interference that affects both sensors equally.",

Piezoresistive sensors are sensitive to temperature changes, which can cause variations in the output signal. To solve this issue, temperature compensation techniques can be used. One common technique is to use a Wheatstone bridge circuit, which balances the resistance of the piezoresistive sensor with a reference resistor. By measuring the voltage across the bridge, the output signal can be compensated for temperature effects. Another technique is to use a thermistor or a temperature sensor to measure the temperature and adjust the output signal accordingly.",

For example, the accelerometer can be affected by vibration or shock, while the gyroscope can drift over time.\n\nOne solution to this issue is to use a more advanced sensor fusion algorithm, such as a Kalman filter or an extended Kalman filter. These algorithms can take into account the uncertainty in the sensor measurements and provide more accurate estimates of the device's orientation. Another solution is to use additional sensors, such as a magnetometer or a GPS, to improve the accuracy of the orientation estimation.

In terms of energy production, the gas turbine method has several benefits compared to other plants, including convenience of starting engine, large power output per mass, low pollutant emission such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides(NOx), etc. Especially for emission, fuels without carbon, for instance, hydrogen and ammonia, is rising as carbon neutrality policies came into effect gradually. [2] To fulfill low-emission system, gas turbine plants with fuel lean-burn can play key roll, which means combustion with excess of air, in addition to efficiency for using fuel. Currently those gas turbine combustors in industrial use adopt premixed flame for the most, which combusts with fuel and oxidizer completely before ignition, because of high effectiveness and low emission compared to diffusion flame, which is fuel and oxidizer separately enter the combustion chamber. Also, there are several types of gas turbine combustors; can type, cannular type, can-anunlar type, and annular type. For can-annular type combustors, which combined type and annular type combustor, are commonly used on industrial fields. There are some advantages of can-annular combustors; easy to maintain as each can be removed easily and wored on independently. [3] On the other hand, there are some risks about fuel lean premixed combustors, including a risk due to premixed flame, which have been resolved to some extent today. The most challenging problem is combustion instability, in presence of lean-burn. Moreover to the combustion instability of the combustor itself, the can-annular type combustors have a additional combustion instability about area called a \"cross-talk section\" that interacts due to the joining at the end of each combustor as Fig.1 shown. This area is used to equalize the pressure in each can [3]. Although instability of can-annular combustor is notable, relatively little research were conducted about combustion instabililty with respect to combustor-to-combustor interaction. The purpose of this paper is to understand basics of characteristics of combustion instabillity, interaction between combustors that could occur in can-annular combustors as well as, comprehending emissions in gas turbine combustor. In the end, we can be expected to use this literature as a reference at future works. [1] K. Moon , H. Jegal , C. Yoon , K.T.

Especially with the rise of carbon-neutral policies, fuels without carbon, such as hydrogen and ammonia, are becoming increasingly important. In order to meet emission standards, gas turbine plants with lean-burn fuel can play a key role in terms of combustion efficiency and low emissions. Currently, most gas turbine combustors in industrial use adopt premixed flames, which completely combust both the fuel and oxidizer before ignition, due to their high effectiveness and low emissions compared to diffusion flames, which allow fuel and oxidizer to enter the combustion chamber separately. The can-annular type combustors, which combine the can and annular types, are commonly used in industrial fields due to their easy maintenance – each can be removed and worked on independently. However, fuel lean premixed combustors carry some risks such as combustion instability, especially in the presence of lean-burn. In can-annular type combustors, this risk is compounded by the presence of a \"cross-talk section\" that interacts due to the joining at the end of each combustor. Although relatively little research has been conducted about combustion instability with respect to combustor-to-combustor interaction, this paper aims to understand the basics of combustion instability, interactions between combustors in can-annular combustors, and emissions in gas turbine combustors, and provide a reference for future work [1][2][3].",

        "response": "Here is a revised version of your paragraph, with some suggestions for improvements: \n\nGas turbine engines have played an important role in various fields for decades, including jet engines, rockets, and power plants. Among them, gas turbines for power generation are one of the main methods of energy generation nowadays. Compared to other power plants, the gas turbine method has several benefits, such as convenience of starting the engine, large power output per mass, and low pollutant emissions, such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxides (NOx). Especially with the rise of carbon-neutral policies, fuels without carbon, such as hydrogen and ammonia, are becoming increasingly important. In order to meet emission standards, gas turbine plants with lean-burn fuel can play a key role in terms of combustion efficiency and low emissions. Currently, most gas turbine combustors in industrial use adopt premixed flames, which completely combust both the fuel and oxidizer before ignition, due to their high effectiveness and low emissions compared to diffusion flames, which allow fuel and oxidizer to enter the combustion chamber separately. The can-annular type combustors, which combine the can and annular types, are commonly used in industrial fields due to their easy maintenance – each can be removed and worked on independently. However, fuel lean premixed combustors carry some risks such as combustion instability, especially in the presence of lean-burn. In can-annular type combustors, this risk is compounded by the presence of a \"cross-talk section\" that interacts due to the joining at the end of each combustor. Although relatively little research has been conducted about combustion instability with respect to combustor-to-combustor interaction, this paper aims to understand the basics of combustion instability, interactions between combustors in can-annular combustors, and emissions in gas turbine combustors, and provide a reference for future work [1][2][3].",

During the testing, participants were presented with cards featuring stimuli in the form of colors, shapes, or numbers, and were asked to categorize the cards accordingly. Initially, participants were instructed to sort the cards by color, and were verbally reinforced for each correct response. Once the participant had correctly sorted 10 cards in a row by color, the verbal reinforcement was removed, and participants needed to continue sorting by form and numbers without any verbal feedback. The ratio of correct responses to errors was then computed, and the numbers of trials, errors, perseverative responses, and perseverative errors were recorded and analyzed. The purpose of the WCST, as described by Berg (1948), is to assess individuals' cognitive flexibility and ability to modify behavior in response to changing environmental cues.",

The data we collected regarding earthquake-related sightings of UFOs from various countries within 300 km of the epicenter, during the seven-day period before the earthquake, helped us in this investigation. We have presented the relevant data in Table 1.\nOur analysis of the data reveals the following. First, the average weekly UFO sightings recorded prior to an earthquake was higher than the overall average. Second, the countries that recorded the highest number of UFO sightings were those with the higher earthquake magnitudes. Specifically, 75 clusters of high-speed light and 6 blue-green egg-shaped objects were reported in the USA and Canada, respectively. Third, in Russia, a green ball of light was reported, while in India, a fast-moving disc was observed. Finally, in Australia, white flashes of light were recorded. \nThus, in support of our hypothesis, it is plausible that the significant increase in the frequency of sightings of UFOs during the seven-day period prior to an earthquake was related to an earthquake's occurrence. Our results support the earthquake lights theory, suggesting that UFO sightings could be used to predict an impending earthquake.

In order to realize imaginative intervention which is called do-operation, the authors construct a confounder dictionary using pre-trained Faster R-CNN. Each entry is the averaged RoI feature of each category. However, according to our study, the averaged RoI features no more retain information about the corresponding class.

To accomplish this, the authors create a confounder dictionary using a pre-trained Faster R-CNN. Each entry in the dictionary is represented by the averaged RoI feature of each category. However, recent findings suggest that the averaged RoI features no longer retain information about their corresponding class. This presents a major issue since each entry in the confounder dictionary is expected to represent a specific class category when intervening. It seems that class information associated with RoI features may be lost when the features are averaged.",

        "response": "‘Efficient High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) Interposer Design with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-Based Eye Diagram Estimation Considering Power Noise’\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this study, we propose an efficient design methodology for high bandwidth memory (HBM) interposer using a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based eye diagram estimation technique. The methodology consists of several steps, including raw data generation, target channel and design parameters set-up, eye diagram simulation set-up, preprocessing of training datasets, determining the number of labels and eye diagram datasets, time series to images transformation methods for input datasets, and building Pix2Pix-based GAN for eye diagram estimation.\nThe process of raw data generation for GAN model training involves several steps, starting with the design specifications of HBM and the definition of the target channel. The design of the HBM interposer and the set-up of design parameters are then carried out, followed by the electromagnetic (EM) simulation of the HBM interposer, S-parameters, and eye diagram. Data collection is performed for training the GAN model. The target channel and design parameters are set up based on the physical dimension and material properties of the HBM interposer. The design target is defined as a victim of a 5mm strip line with adjacent aggressors, and the target channel is designed by fixing the thickness of all layers as 1 um.\nFor the eye diagram simulation set-up, the input voltage Vin is set to an amplitude of 0.4V, a data rate of 6.4Gbps, and a rise/fall time of 15.6ps/15.6ps. Equivalent source/load elements are set as TX: 50Ω/0.5pF as an equivalent source resistance and load capacitance, and RX: 0.5pF as an equivalent load capacitance, following JEDEC standard JESD238 (HBM3). To evaluate the Power Supply Induced Jitter (PSIJ) in the proposed HBM interposer design, we designed a Power Delivery Network (PDN) to supply power to the HBM interposer. We applied power noise generated by switching multiple drivers simultaneously to the eye diagram simulation. This allowed us to analyze the effects of power noise on signal integrity in the HBM interposer. We examined various factors, such as noise margin, jitter, and eye opening, to investigate the impact of power noise on the design of the interposer. Through this analysis, we were able to identify potential PSIJ issues and propose solutions to mitigate them, thereby improving the overall performance and reliability of the HBM interposer design.\nPreprocessing of training datasets involves EM simulation & Transient simulation using HFSS and ADS to extract raw data (csv file) containing labels like width, space, index, time, and density. MATLAB is then used to process raw data, plot eye diagrams, and save image datasets. Python is used to preprocess images, label datasets, create hierarchical data formats file with datasets (HDF5 file), extract datasets, build a GAN network, and train GAN. The number of labels and eye diagram datasets are determined based on the setting of two labels representing width and space, respectively. The minimum and maximum values of the parameters of each label and the step-size determine the total number of datasets. \nTime series to images transformation methods are employed for input datasets. 1-D time series data with high feature complexity due to sequential data can be transformed to enable data analysis through 2-D convolution. Finally, to build a Pix2Pix-based GAN for eye diagram estimation, a dataset containing input images and their corresponding target images is required. Pix2Pix is a supervised learning algorithm that takes an input image and produces an output image in a different style. It has been successfully applied to various image-to-image translation tasks.\nIn summary, our proposed methodology enables the design and analysis of the entire eye diagram with power noise without conventional time-consuming processes. It also presents a GAN-based eye diagram estimation methodology for fast and optimal design of HBM interposer.\n",

The principles of GAN training were analyzed through the objective function, and the analysis of the training progress of GAN was conducted through discriminator and generator error.\n\nRegarding the principles of GAN training, it was found that binary cross-entropy can be applied to the discriminator in GANs, as the discriminator in GANs is a binary classification problem representing true as 1.0 and false as 0.0. It was also observed that cross-entropy can be greater than 1.0 with logarithmic calculations, providing much greater feedback on the wrong answer. The ideal Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss is 0.693 in situations where the discriminator and generator are balanced.\n\nIn the analysis of training progress of GAN, it was noted that according to the mathematical definition of binary cross-entropy, the ideal value of the loss function is ln 2. If the error of the discriminator is less than the ideal value, the discriminator outpaces the generator, and if it is similar to the ideal value, the generator is being trained well. It was found that the error in the discriminator is oscillated in between, indicating that the discriminator and generator compete with each other and learn well.\n \n\tFigure 1 Error in discriminator according to epoch shows the process of convergence\n \n\n\nFigure 2 Error in generator according to epoch ensures that the generator is trained well\n\nAs the epoch increases, the generator converges appropriately to produce various and plausible data. It is shown that if the epoch is excessively increased, the learning quality may deteriorate. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the training progress of GAN and eye diagram estimation. These findings can be useful in the design of efficient HBM interposer with GAN-based eye diagram estimation, considering power noise.\n \nFigure 3 Eye diagrams generated by GAN by epoch\n",

Here are some suggestions for revisions to make it even stronger:\n\n- Consider starting the paragraph with a clear statement of your main findings before diving into the details about GAN training principles and progress analysis.\n\n- Provide more context for why the GAN-based eye diagram estimation is important, and how it relates to the design of HBM interposers.\n\n- Specify what software or tools were used to generate the eye diagrams and analyze the GAN training progress.\n\n- Use clearer and more specific language. For example, instead of \"much greater feedback\", you could say \"more informative feedback\".\n\n- Combine and condense some of the points. For example, the first and second sentences of the second paragraph could be combined into one sentence.\n\n- Provide more explanation for the figures and how they support your findings. For example, in Figure 1, what is the y-axis representing? How does the change in the error over the epochs demonstrate the process of convergence?\n\nOverall, your results section has good information and structure. With a few revisions and clarification, it can become even stronger.",

It should be brief and focused solely on summarizing the key findings of the study, without presenting any new information or interpretation. In contrast, the discussion offers a more detailed analysis and interpretation of the results, and often presents possible explanations for those results. The discussion section is where you can speculate about potential mechanisms underlying your observations or propose future research directions. The conclusion, therefore, offers a brief summary of the study's main findings, while the discussion offers a more in-depth analysis and interpretation of the results, including their broader significance or potential implications. Does that help clarify the difference between the discussion and the conclusion?",

Actually, this result couldn’t reflect the relationship between the existence of siblings and personality. We have difficult to evaluate hypotheses that having brothers and sisters has an extroverted personality than only child.\nFor this reason, we retry to examine the individual results as you can see in Fig 2. The number of students of the introverted is 7 and the extroverted is 6 among having siblings, respectively, while the number of students of the introverted is 1 and the extroverted is 1 that exhibited the same number among only child. It is shown that the presence or absence of siblings is not directly related to the personality type (extroverted and introverted)\nAs a result, it exhibited the hypothesis that having siblings is relatively extroverted than only child. It seems that there are many factors like the environment of growth. And thus, it could not conclude a person’s personality by having brothers and sisters. Also, considering that the subject of investigation is a very small standard group of class students, it is judged that the number of standard groups should be increased for a more accurate comparative analysis.",

However, there are a few suggestions that may help improve the clarity of your writing. Firstly, in the first sentence, consider rephrasing the sentence to \"Our study investigated the relationship between personality types and the presence or absence of siblings among students in the F class of Scientific Writing.\"\n\nSecondly, in the third sentence, it would be helpful to provide the actual number of students in the survey, for example \"Out of the total number of students surveyed, 86.7% were only child while 13.3% had siblings.\"\n\nThirdly, the sentence \"Actually, this result couldn't reflect the relationship between the existence of siblings and personality.\" is a bit unclear. Consider rephrasing it to \"However, the results obtained were inconclusive in establishing a relationship between the presence or absence of siblings and personality traits.\"\n\nFinally, in the fourth and fifth paragraph, you did a great job of explaining the findings and interpreting the results. However, the sentences could be refined and restructured to enhance clarity. Consider breaking them down into smaller statements, with clear and concise wording. For example, \"Based on the survey, the number of students exhibiting introverted characteristics was similar in both the only-child and having-siblings group. However, there was a higher percentage of extroverted students among the having-siblings group.\"\n\nOverall, great work! Keep practicing and refining your scientific writing skills.",

Could you give me some feedback about context or grammer? \"We prepared a cationic liposome coated with TCSA (taurocholic acid-chondroitin sulfate) by electrostatic attraction (Figure 1A). The cationic liposome was prepared with DOPC, cholesterol, DOTAP and TPGS in a ratio of 4: 2: 3: 1. DOPC and cholesterol were used for stability of liposome, TPGS acted as an inhibitor of p-gp activity, and DOTAP was used for TCSA polymer coating. \n\nTo coat the cationic liposome with TCSA polymer stably, the concentration of TCSA was optimized (Figure 1B). At the polymer concentration of w/w one-fifth and half, the zeta potential value shows -28.8 and -28.5 respectively and it indicates the liposome was coated stably. However, in case of the w/w concentration of 1/10 and 1/20, the concentration of polymer was too low so the zeta potential value shows positive charge of cationic liposome. Since the residual amount of polymer was not separately purified, we processed polymer coating with one-fifth w/w concentration of TCSA. The final nanoparticles coated with TCSA size distribution, PDI, and zeta potential were 74.87 nm, 0.276, and -30.2 mV, respectively (Figure 1C).\"\n",

Our nanoplatform is designed with conjugation of taurocholic acid polymer to drug-loaded cationic liposome via electrostatic attraction. This developed nanoparticle demonstrated increased absorption ability, which is one of the limitations for oral delivery, compared to other non-coating groups and showed powerful anti-cancer efficacy through apoptosis test. Furthermore, the tocofersolan modification on liposome for p-gp inhibition also proved the synergistic effect by inhibiting drug efflux from cancer cell resulting in maximizing the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin on cancer cell.\nThe development of the effective oral nanoplatform implies that it might provide an innovatory and convenient quality of anti-cancer treatment for cancer patients. Also, this nanoplatform can apply to other intravenous drugs of bacterial diseases as well as other cancer types for conversion to oral administration. Its possibilities are endless due to the properties of lipid platform synthesized microfluidic device. Though this research has used taurocholic acid which is one type of secondary bile acids for oral ability of nanoparticle, other secondary bile acid like glycocholic acid might have superior ability to apply on drug delivery platform. We found the targeting efficacy of taurocholic acid in this paper so the next step for commercialization of oral administration is optimization of the bile acids. These efforts might open the opportunities for improved quality of life to suffering cancer patients. \n\nThis is my writing. ",

Commas are used to separate coordinate adjectives (adjectives that modify a noun independently of each other). For example: \"The bright, sunny day was perfect for a picnic.\"\n\n2. Commas are used to separate independent clauses when they are joined by a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so). For example: \"I love spending time outdoors, but I also enjoy reading inside.\"\n\n3. Commas are used to enclose introductory elements such as phrases, clauses, or adverbial phrases at the beginning of a sentence. For example: \"While I was running, I saw a deer in the woods.\"\n\n4. Commas are used to set off nonessential elements within a sentence. For example: \"The book, which was written by a famous author, became a bestseller.\"\n\nThese are just a few examples of situations where we use commas in scientific writing.

CNNs use multiple arrays to store weights in a feature map and extract information. Since the data is collected through pulse-echo mode, the attenuation of the signal is not obvious, which requires the advanced feature extraction ability of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In CNN training, even for the same data, 1-D CNN recognizes and extracts time series information, and 2-D CNN extracts spatial information caused by nonlinearity as different information. To utilize these features, we devised a deep ensemble CNN (DECNN). This network is composed of two architectures: a 1-D CNN that uses 1-D laser ultrasound signals as input, and a 2-D CNN that rearranges the 1-D signals into 2-D to extract features. The values from each architecture are then flattened into a single layer and classified through a softmax layer. For each architecture of 1-D CNN and 2-D CNN, batch normalization is used to improve the performance of the gradient after convolution, and the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) layer is used as an activation function to prevent gradient vanishing[11,12]. The detailed architecture and hyperparameters of the CNN are listed in Figure 4, Table 2. The developed DECNN was trained using Matlab R2023b with CPU Intel i7-12700K and GPU NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090Ti.  The performance evaluation of the network evaluates the multi-classification model based on True positive, True negative, False positive, and False negative present in the confusion matrix of the test set. To evaluate the multi-classification model, accuracy, mean average precision, and recall are used as performance metrics, and these values are calculated. All performance metrics were calculated with k-fold cross-validation to verify the bias of the data. The formulas precision and recall are given in Eqn. 1. and Eqn. 2., respectively.\n\nAre any of these sentences grammatically incorrect?",

In our study, we manufactured a 3D Printed CFRP composite control surface and acquired UWPI data through laser ultrasonic testing. In addition, robust normal and defect data of the specimen were acquired and labeled through X-ray Micro-CT and image processing techniques. DECNN was devised and designed to learn the labeled data, and GAN was designed to solve the data imbalance problem. In this section, we present the analysis of signals with different sizes and features at different depths, the results of DECNN training, and the visualization of the defect detection diagnosed by the AI with specific figures. Perform 5-Fold Cross Validation with validation data not used for training and calculate the network's performance metric values. To demonstrate the effectiveness of data augmentation, we compare the performance metrics of the network before and after data augmentation.

You could clarify the connection between these by adding a sentence like: \"This labeled data was used to train a deep learning model, specifically a novel type of convolutional neural network called the DECNN.\"\n- In the second-to-last sentence, you could specify what types of defects were detected: \"With the finalized DECNN model, we visualize surface defects on the validation control surfaces in 3D to provide quantitative information on the location and size of the detected defects.\"\n\nOverall, great job summarizing your study!",

My introduction is as follows.\n\nMuscle fatigue is usually defined as a reduction in maximum force[1]. Decreases in muscle force production have been shown to be detrimental in various situation, and muscle fatigue leads to postural instability[2] and affects the ability of limb control[3]. The detection and assessment of muscle fatigue are essential to prevent sports injuries and work-related musculoskeletal disorders. If the accumulation of muscle fatigue is not resolved, it will lead to overwork, and muscle damage and even threatens human health[4].\n\tInvestigating the musculoskeletal system of human is challenging because of the complexity of the interactions between biological and neurological factors[5]. There are many factors that affect muscle fatigue including the length and volume change of muscle, imbalance of intramuscular chemical components, and some other neurological impairment. Although it is almost impossible to determine the proportion of each factor, all factors can contribute to muscle fatigue, and it can partially explain why it is challenging to represent the muscle model analytically.",

You've used commas, semicolons, and colons in a way that enhances the clarity and coherence of the text.",

Various approaches have been used to develop muscle fatigue models. The first muscle fatigue model was proposed by Rohmert[6], introducing the relationship between the percentage of maximum muscle exerted and endurance time during static contraction. It showed that if the force exerted is less than 15% MVC, the muscle can sustain indefinitely. A fatigue model based on the Ca2+ cross-bridge mechanism was proposed and verified via a simulation experiment[7]. However, there were too many parameters to consider, which required a huge amount of calculation.\n\tLike this, muscle fatigue models have been developed before, but some adapt to the static condition, and others are limited to be dynamic motions. Thus, a generalized muscle fatigue and recovery model that is computationally friendly and reflects the physiological change needs to be developed.\n\tThis study aimed to develop a muscle fatigue model that can be applied to dynamic fatigue tasks with physiological changes caused by muscle fatigue. The model was based on an existing muscle model with several muscle parameters. The overall process will be divided into several detailed objectives: First, proper muscle parameters were identified to express muscle fatigue and recovery based on the existing muscle model. Second, muscle fatigue and recovery were quantified by performing an experiment to determine the muscle model parameters.",

I like how you've mentioned the current limitations of existing models, such as their adaptability to either static or dynamic conditions, and the computational burdens associated with some models.\n\nAdditionally, you've used colons appropriately to introduce the detailed objectives of your study. The use of semicolons in the last sentence of the introduction provides the reader with the necessary pause to appreciate the research's complexity.\n\nOverall, I think your introduction has a good flow of ideas, includes appropriate punctuation, and takes the reader smoothly from the general problem to the specific objectives of the research.

This small modification reflects that muscle fatigue's effect is an ongoing issue and has continued to impact various situations.\n\n2. In the second sentence, it might be useful to change \"musculoskeletal system of human\" to \"human musculoskeletal system\" to make it sound more natural.\n\n3. In the fifth sentence, I suggest that you change \"all factors can contribute to muscle fatigue\" to \"all factors can contribute to the occurrence of muscle fatigue\" to make the meaning clearer.\n\nThese modifications are minor, and your introduction is already good.

SLF technologies enable non-manual and non-invasive supervision by automatically monitoring animal’s body parameters, behavior, activity level and pose information etc. This is cost-effective and less stressful for the animals due to less human intervention. Among SLF’s tools, computer vision (CV) has made many improvements in livestock operations [ 2]. Many studies have used low-level CV, such as image processing [3] and high-level CV technology, such as image classification [4– 6 ], object detection [7, 8] and segmentation [ 9,10 ], to monitor the health and welfare of pig. Image classification has been used to classify pig behaviors [ 4 ], detect abnormal behavior [ 5] or disease on body parts [ 6 ]. Studies have also been conducted to estimate the body composition traits [ 11 ] and their body weights [12 ] for regression.

        "response": "Great, let's start revising your essay with parallelism! \n\nFirst, let's look at your thesis statement. It is clear, but we can make it more parallel to emphasize your main points. One way to do this is to use a \"not only, but also\" structure. You can say \"Not only should the government help those most in need, but it should also avoid providing aid to those who are wealthy.\" This structure helps to show the contrast between the two sides of your argument, and also creates a parallel sentence structure. \n\nNext, let's look at your body paragraphs. You mentioned two reasons for your opinion, so we can make those more parallel as well. For example:\n\n- First, by focusing aid on those most in need, the government can ensure that resources are not wasted on those who do not require it. This targeted approach can provide greater support for those struggling to make ends meet.\n- Second, providing aid to the wealthy creates a disparity in the distribution of resources. The government has a responsibility to prioritize the needs of its most vulnerable citizens, rather than providing unnecessary aid to those who already have the means to support themselves.  \n\nIn both of these statements, we used similar sentence structures and parallel phrasing to make the argument clearer and more cohesive. \n\nNow let's move on to your conclusion. You can use parallel structure here as well to summarize your main points. For example:\n\n- In conclusion, the government should focus its aid on those who are most in need, rather than attempting to provide assistance to all citizens. By doing so, we can ensure that resources are distributed more fairly, and that those who require the most support receive it. \n\nHere, we used similar phrasing to the thesis statement at the beginning of the essay, which creates a sense of closure and reinforces your argument. \n\nRemember to keep your ideas clear, concise, and parallel throughout the essay. I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any further questions!",

Firstly, providing support to all citizens could result in the neglect of those who are in dire need of assistance. For instance, elderly citizens who live alone in poverty-stricken environments may not receive adequate help from the government despite their desperate need for assistance. By focusing on providing support to those who are most in need, the government can ensure that it allocates resources where they are most required. Secondly, providing assistance to wealthy citizens who don't need it would be unjust. It is well known that a small proportion of the population holds the majority of the nation's wealth. Therefore, to promote equality, the government should concentrate on assisting those who are most in need, rather than spreading out resources. \n\nDoes this revised paragraph make sense to you?",

Let's go through your revised essay together and see if we can make any additional improvements.\n\nI share your belief that the government should provide aid to those who are most in need, rather than to all citizens. There are several reasons why I agree with this viewpoint.\n\nFirstly, if the government tries to help everyone, it is inevitable that some of the most vulnerable people in society will be overlooked. For example, there are many elderly citizens who live alone in poverty and desperately need support. If the government's resources are spread too thin, these individuals are unlikely to get the assistance they require. Therefore, I believe that the government should concentrate its efforts on supporting the most disadvantaged members of society.\n\nSecondly, it is unfair for wealthy individuals to receive government benefits when they don't need them. I think that those who have an abundance of resources should be required to contribute more to society. For instance, it is a well-established fact that a small minority of individuals possess the majority of wealth in our country. In order to create a more equitable society for everyone, I believe that the wealthy should pay higher taxes and be willing to contribute more to social welfare initiatives.\n\nOverall, I believe that the government should focus its resources on aiding those who are most in need. This is particularly important given the deep divide between the rich and the poor in our society. I am confident that if we all work together and extend a helping hand to those who require it the most, we can create a better world for ourselves and for future generations. \n\nGreat job!

These people desperately need help, but it is true that people in need don't get enough help from the government. It will be worse when government expands the range of people who get supported. Consequently, I think minority of people should get a concentrated help. \n  Second, people who are very wealthy don't need any help from the government. I believe it is right for people to help each other. Rich people shouldn't receive benefits from the government. Rather, they have to pay more. It is a well-known fact that minority of super-rich people own majority of the wealth. Hence, to make our society a better place for everyone, people should be less selfish.\n  These are two reasons why I believe government should help those most in need. We live in a society where the gap between the rich and the poor is very large. To overcome this, not only government but all of us should try hard, and take care of each other.\n\nI revised my essay",

        "response": "Great work! Let's go through your revised essay together and see if we can make any additional improvements.\n\nI share your belief that the government should provide aid to those who are most in need, rather than to all citizens. There are several reasons why I agree with this viewpoint.\n\nFirstly, if the government tries to help everyone, it is inevitable that some of the most vulnerable people in society will be overlooked. For example, there are many elderly citizens who live alone in poverty and desperately need support. If the government's resources are spread too thin, these individuals are unlikely to get the assistance they require. Therefore, I believe that the government should concentrate its efforts on supporting the most disadvantaged members of society.\n\nSecondly, it is unfair for wealthy individuals to receive government benefits when they don't need them. I think that those who have an abundance of resources should be required to contribute more to society. For instance, it is a well-established fact that a small minority of individuals possess the majority of wealth in our country. In order to create a more equitable society for everyone, I believe that the wealthy should pay higher taxes and be willing to contribute more to social welfare initiatives.\n\nOverall, I believe that the government should focus its resources on aiding those who are most in need. This is particularly important given the deep divide between the rich and the poor in our society. I am confident that if we all work together and extend a helping hand to those who require it the most, we can create a better world for ourselves and for future generations. \n\nGreat job! Your revised essay is clear and well-written, and your use of conjunctive adverbs has improved the flow of your writing. Keep up the good work!",

Let's go through each section of your essay and make the necessary revisions.\n\nIntroduction:\nYour introduction is good, but it could be stronger. You should provide a bit more context and background information to help the reader understand the issue you are discussing. Additionally, your thesis statement could be more specific. Here's a revised introduction:\n\nThe issue of government assistance is a contentious one, with many people arguing that the government should help all citizens, while others believe that resources should be focused on those who are most in need. In this essay, I will argue that the government should prioritize helping the most vulnerable members of society. By doing so, we can create a more equitable society that benefits everyone.\n\nBody:\nYour body paragraphs are well-organized and present strong arguments. However, you could provide more evidence to support your claims. Additionally, you should address potential counterarguments to strengthen your position. Here are some revisions to your body paragraphs:\n\nParagraph 1:\nFirstly, it is important to recognize that there are many vulnerable members of society who require government assistance. For example, elderly citizens who live alone in poverty often struggle to make ends meet and require support to maintain a decent standard of living. However, if the government tries to help everyone, it is inevitable that some of these individuals will be overlooked. This is because resources are limited, and it is difficult to provide comprehensive support to everyone. Therefore, it is essential that the government focuses its efforts on supporting the most disadvantaged members of society.\n\nParagraph 2:\nSecondly, it is unfair for wealthy individuals to receive government benefits when they don't need them. While some argue that everyone should receive equal treatment, this ignores the fact that some people have more resources than others. In order to create a more equitable society, it is important that those who have an abundance of resources contribute more to social welfare initiatives. This can be achieved through higher taxes and other measures that ensure that the burden of supporting those in need is shared more equitably.\n\nConclusion:\nYour conclusion is good, but it could be more impactful. You should restate your thesis statement and summarize your main arguments. Additionally, you could provide a call to action to encourage the reader to take action. Here's a revised conclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, the government should prioritize helping the most vulnerable members of society. By doing so, we can create a more equitable society that benefits everyone. This can be achieved through targeted support for those in need, as well as measures that ensure that the burden of supporting those in need is shared more equitably. I urge everyone to consider the importance of this issue and to take action to support those who require assistance. Together, we can create a better world for ourselves and for future generations.",

Let's go through each section of your essay and make the necessary revisions.\n\nIntroduction:\nYour introduction is good, but it could be stronger. You should provide a bit more context and background information to help the reader understand the issue you are discussing. Additionally, your thesis statement could be more specific. Here's a revised introduction:\n\nThe issue of government assistance is a contentious one, with many people arguing that the government should help all citizens, while others believe that resources should be focused on those who are most in need. In this essay, I will argue that the government should prioritize helping the most vulnerable members of society. By doing so, we can create a more equitable society that benefits everyone.\n\nBody:\nYour body paragraphs are well-organized and present strong arguments. However, you could provide more evidence to support your claims. Additionally, you should address potential counterarguments to strengthen your position. Here are some revisions to your body paragraphs:\n\nParagraph 1:\nFirstly, it is important to recognize that there are many vulnerable members of society who require government assistance. For example, elderly citizens who live alone in poverty often struggle to make ends meet and require support to maintain a decent standard of living. However, if the government tries to help everyone, it is inevitable that some of these individuals will be overlooked. This is because resources are limited, and it is difficult to provide comprehensive support to everyone. Therefore, it is essential that the government focuses its efforts on supporting the most disadvantaged members of society.\n\nParagraph 2:\nSecondly, it is unfair for wealthy individuals to receive government benefits when they don't need them. While some argue that everyone should receive equal treatment, this ignores the fact that some people have more resources than others. In order to create a more equitable society, it is important that those who have an abundance of resources contribute more to social welfare initiatives. This can be achieved through higher taxes and other measures that ensure that the burden of supporting those in need is shared more equitably.\n\nConclusion:\nYour conclusion is good, but it could be more impactful. You should restate your thesis statement and summarize your main arguments. Additionally, you could provide a call to action to encourage the reader to take action. Here's a revised conclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, the government should prioritize helping the most vulnerable members of society. By doing so, we can create a more equitable society that benefits everyone. This can be achieved through targeted support for those in need, as well as measures that ensure that the burden of supporting those in need is shared more equitably. I urge everyone to consider the importance of this issue and to take action to support those who require assistance. Together, we can create a better world for ourselves and for future generations.",

However, I think using a tablet/laptop computer is the best way to study in class efficiently. I have three reasons why using a tablet/labtop computer has the advantages in class.\n First, we can search an information what we want to know easily. While the class, we might have questions about the class. By using a tablet/laptop computer we can search at Internet and obtain informations what we want to know. We do not need to stop the class and ask to professor. We can have answers about the questions with no interrupt to the class.\n Second, we can note or type faster and more organized than writing by pen or pencil. We can copy the text or image quickly by using the function of tablet/laptop computer. It is more efficient than hand writing. We can also record the lecture in class. This makes an opportunity to study more about after the class. Moreover, we do not need to worry about lossing notes. It is easily saved at the tablet/laptop computer.\n Lastly, we can save space and time. Without a tablet/laptop computer, we should have large space to study if we want to look at lots of book at once. However, by using a tablet/laptop computer we can look at enormous documents with a space of one book. We can also  save time to gather books or documents. Internet can make this possible.\n In conclusion, we can search informations what we want to know quickly, make more  organized notes than hand writing, and save space and time to study. Because of these advantages of using a tablet/laptop computer in class, I encourage you to study  with a tablet/laptop computer if you want to receive good scores.",

It's a good idea to start with a clear thesis statement. Can you clarify your main argument in the first sentence? \n\nAfterward, your body paragraphs are quite solid! You have three distinct points that support your thesis statement, and you explain them in a clear and concise way. However, there are some grammatical and spelling errors that we can correct, so let's work on that. \n\nAlso, to make your essay more persuasive, can you provide some evidence to support your claims? For instance, when you argue that using a tablet/laptop computer is more efficient than writing by hand, can you provide some actual examples of that efficiency? \n\nFinally, let's work on your conclusion. You have the right idea by summarizing your main points but adding some final thoughts or recommendations to make it more meaningful would be great. \n\nOverall, excellent job!

The criteria you use to organize the taxonomy will depend on the specific research question and the number of articles you included in your survey. However, some of the following criteria may be helpful when developing a taxonomy for your literature review in the field of Vision Transformer architectures to solve Video Super Resolution tasks:\n\n1. Methodological approach: You can organize techniques based on the methodological approach. For instance, one category could be for CNN-based methods, while another category could be for Vision Transformer-based methods. \n\n2. Performance metrics: You could group techniques by the performance metrics used to evaluate their results—for example, PSNR, SSIM, or perceptual quality indices.\n\n3. Dataset type: This criterion is related to the dataset that each technique employed for training or testing. For example, you could group methods based on the type of dataset they used, for instance, natural image datasets or synthetic datasets.\n\n4. Network architecture: You may also categorize techniques based on their network architectures.\n\n5. Feature extraction methods: Techniques used to extract the features can be grouped under this criterion, for instance, using pre-trained networks or unsupervised feature extraction.\n\nThese categories can be further divided. For example, you can group CNN-based methods based on the type of the CNN architecture used (like VGG, ResNet, or DenseNet). \n\nThese are just a few examples, but the criteria you choose will ultimately depend on the goals of your review and the information you hope to extract from the studies.",

Start with a clear understanding of the main research areas in deep learning, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.\n\n2. Collect a large number of deep learning papers from top-tier conferences, journals, and preprint servers such as arXiv. You can use search engines like Google Scholar or specialized databases such as Semantic Scholar to facilitate this process.\n\n3. Read and summarize each paper, paying attention to the research question, methodology, experimental setup, evaluation metrics, and results.\n\n4. Identify common themes and sub-areas within deep learning. This can be done manually by clustering papers based on keywords, or automatically through machine learning techniques such as topic modeling or network analysis.\n\n5. Develop a taxonomy that organizes the papers into a hierarchical structure, with the main research areas at the top level and sub-areas and specific topics at lower levels. You can use visualization tools such as mind maps or dendrograms to help you visualize the taxonomy.\n\n6. Continuously update and refine the taxonomy as new papers are published and as your understanding of the field evolves.",

This is abstract of my research, and I need korean version, but papago makes too many mistakes. \n\nThe text is below:\n\nData-parallelism has been widely used in order to distribute the training of large DNN networks among multiple workers (GPU/TPU). In the data-parallel context, a large proportion of the training time is spent on collective communication to synchronize gradients between model replicas on each device. Up to 40\\% of the training time is spent on All-Reduce collective communication.\nIt was observed that not all gradients are necessary for model convergence and the gradient tensor could be greatly sparsified to reduce the communication volume.\nPrior works proposed to prune gradients depending on their magnitude, approach colloquially called top-k. However, top-k incurs computation overhead of bitonic sorting and has scalability issues on Ring All-Reduce due to the necessity to send indices.\nIn this work, we show that random gradient pruning guarantees convergence at minimal accuracy loss. Moreover, we propose Skip-Reduce -- a novel approach to perform gradient pruning that does not rely on sending indices and instead modifies the underlying communication algorithm. Our approach has no computational overhead and is scalable on any number of devices.",

The passage is below:\n\nTo evaluate Skip-Reduce, we train DNN models on two systems: 4GPU system and 8GPU system, as described in the Section 5.1. For 4GPU system, we evaluate four pruning options: Skipping 1 Reduce-Scatter (RS) step, Skipping 2 RS steps, Skipping 1 RS and 1 All-Gather (AG) steps, and Adaptive Skip-Reduce. For 8GPU system, the options are similar, except the number of skipped steps is scaled twofold, i.e.: 2RS steps, 4RS steps, 2RS and 2AG steps. \n\nThe Adaptive Skip-Reduce varied for each DNN model. For ResNet50 and VGG16, he schedule consisted of 75 epochs with Skipping 2 RS, followed by 75 epochs with Skipping 1 RS, and finally the last 50 epochs with no pruning. For YOLO, it is [250, 250, 100] in the same order. On 8GPU system, the schedules are identical or similar, except the pruning options are scaled appropriately (e.g., Skipping 2RS becomes Skipping 4RS and etc.).\n\nFigures \\ref{fig:resnet50_skip}, \\ref{fig:vgg16_skip}, \\ref{fig:bert_skip}, \\ref{fig:yolo_skip} show the test accuracy (F1/mAP score) plots for all evaluated DNNs with Skip-Reduce.

To conduct the experiment, the DNN models were trained on two different systems: a 4GPU system and an 8GPU system. Four different pruning options were evaluated on the 4GPU system, while a scaled version of these options was tested on the 8GPU system. The Adaptive Skip-Reduce technique was also applied to each DNN model, using a different schedule for each one. The results of the experiment are shown in Figures \\ref{fig:resnet50_skip}, \\ref{fig:vgg16_skip}, \\ref{fig:bert_skip}, \\ref{fig:yolo_skip}, and tables containing the achieved convergence results are also included.

We achieved notable performance benefits without loss in accuracy, most notably 11.25% speed-up in ResNet50 training and 25.75% speed-up in VGG16 training. \n\nSkip-Reduce performs random pruning by skipping devices, thereby saving time on All-Reduce operations. Unlike previous work, Skip-Reduce does not suffer from scalability issues on Ring AllReduce and does not require expensive gradient sorting operations. It allows costless random pruning at any percentage, overcoming the need to send the indices along with the retained gradients. \n\nWith more devices in the ring, Skip-Reduce enables fine-grained choices of skipping steps and pruning percentages. Moreover, using Adaptive Skip-Reduce allows the design of more sophisticated pruning strategies, providing a trade-off between accuracy and performance.\n\nDue to the lack of available computing resources, the evaluations in this work were done on relatively small systems (4-GPU and 8-GPU), however the performance benefit is expected to be greater in large-scale systems, consisting of hundreds of devices. Despite these limitations, this work has presented notable improvement on a 8-GPU system and has shown theoretical analysis of large-scale systems. Generalizing Skip-Reduce to other algorithms and hierarchical systems will be a focus for future research.\n\nThis work introduced a practical approach for random pruning with guaranteed performance benefits and without scalability issues on Ring All-Reduce.\n\n",

I changed \"everyone in class uses some devices\" to \"everyone in class tends to use some form of technology\" to make the sentence less repetitive and more specific. The new version indicates that not everyone uses a tablet or laptop, but most students use some form of technology in class.\n3. I changed \"will make students distracted\" to \"can be distracting\" to indicate that the problem is not absolute, and that not all students are necessarily distracted.\n4. I used more descriptive phrases like \"necessary digital abilities\" and \"bulky textbooks\" to clarify the meaning of the sentence and make it more readable.\n5. In the paragraphs where you listed the benefits, I changed \"Therefore using tablets and laptops\" to \"Using tablets and laptops\", which sounds more precise and succinct.\n6. I added the word \"productive\" to the sentence \"Therefore, using tablets and laptops increases students' productivity and engagement during class\" to indicate a specific benefit of using digital devices.\n7.

However, some argue that using tablets and laptops can be distracting. Despite the potential side effects, the use of tablets/laptops has many advantages, which are highlighted below.\n\nThe first benefit is that digital devices allow students to use the necessary digital abilities required for their classes. Many professors provide “lecture notes” to students, which they need to access during class time. Taking notes on laptops and tablets improves students’ learning and memorization abilities. Additionally, subjects such as programming, design, and composition often require the use of digital devices during class. Therefore, using tablets and laptops increases students' productivity and engagement during class.\n\nSecondly, digital devices can help reduce the burden on students during campus life. Devices like tablets can replace bulky textbooks, various types of notes, pens/pencils, and memo sheets. All necessary equipment for studying is contained in a single portable device. Furthermore, students can perform various functions on a tablet, such as recording lectures and submitting assignments online, making studying more convenient and efficient.\n\nThe third benefit is that professors and TAs can execute more efficient work styles by incorporating electronic devices into their classes. By using such devices, teachers can receive assignments online, automatically check grades and attendance, and present lectures more effectively. Many professors are already adopting digital systems in their classes. Thus, using tablets and laptops in class can make not just students but also professors and TAs comfortable and efficient.\n\nAlthough there are numerous advantages, some users may use tablets and laptops inappropriately. However, such issues can be tackled by encouraging healthy habits and self-discipline among students, rather than implementing policies that prohibit the use of digital devices. Therefore, tablets and laptops should be allowed in class, given the advantages mentioned above.\n\nare there any sentence that is to long or short?",

Clustering is one of the unsupervised learning methods, which analyzes the characteristics of given data, and groups data with similar properties into the same group, and data with different properties into different groups.\nAmong the clustering methodologies, we will use a distance-based clustering algorithm, and the algorithm used in the experiment in this paper is the k-medoid algorithm. Most distance-based algorithms require the actual distance and mean points of the data. As mentioned earlier, time series data cannot be matched with dimensional points, so we created a distance matrix that can represent the similarity of time series; however, the actual distance and mean points of the data still cannot be represented. Therefore, we used the k-medoid algorithm based on medoid points rather than mean points. The process of the K-medoid algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. Initializing K & Center: Specify how many clusters we want to classify into as a value of k, and randomly select k out of server instances to initialize them as the center of each cluster.\n2. Clustering: Designate each server instance as the cluster of the nearest center.\n3. Updating Center: Updates the server instance with the lowest cost in each cluster to the center. Cost is the sum of distances from one server instance to all server instances in the same cluster.\n4. Termination Condition: Repeat steps 2-3 until the centers of all clusters are not updated.\n",

That is, to be specific, to be precise without over-specifying details, to avoid complex wordings, to avoid stacking adjectives before nouns, to avoid ambiguity with pretention choice of word, to punctuate properly, to use strong verb, to eliminate redundancies, and, to vary sentence openers.",

        "response": "Yes, it sounds like you learned a lot about the key elements of scientific writing. Modal verbs are important for expressing degrees of certainty or possibility in your writing, while active voice helps to make your writing more clear and direct. Passive voice can be useful in certain situations, but it's important to use it sparingly and only when it's necessary. It's also important to use appropriate sentences in scientific writing, which means being specific and precise without over-specifying details, avoiding complex wordings, and using strong verbs. Additionally, proper punctuation, avoiding redundancies, and varying sentence openers are all important elements of effective scientific writing. Great job!",
